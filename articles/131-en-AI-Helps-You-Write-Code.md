## What Can AI Programming Actually Do?

Many people think programming is only for programmers, and has nothing to do with them. But now AI can help you write code, and it's as simple as just talking.

Let me give you a real example: My friend is a product manager with zero programming knowledge. Last week he wanted to make a small data reporting tool. He simply told ChatGPT, "Make me an Excel merge tool that lets me select multiple files, merge them with one click, and generate statistics." In less than 20 minutes, AI gave him a Python script, he installed Python, and it worked.

This is the current state of AI programming: the barrier is incredibly low, and the results are surprisingly good.

## Programming Scenarios Anyone Can Use

### 1. Data Processing and Reports

- Excel batch processing
- Merging multiple files
- Data format conversion
- Automatically generating statistical charts

These small tasks you used to need help with, now just copy and paste the requirements and AI gives you the code directly.

### 2. File Automation

- Batch file renaming
- Organizing files by rules
- Batch image compression
- Extracting text from PDFs

Install Python or Node.js, copy the code AI gives you, and you're good to go.

### 3. Web Scraping

- Extracting website data
- Monitoring competitor prices
- Automatically collecting news

Just don't break any laws.

### 4. Office Automation

- Batch Word document processing
- Auto-generating PowerPoint
- Batch sending emails
- Auto-organizing schedules

## How Programmers Use AI to Help with Programming

If you're already a programmer, AI helping you write code can save a lot of time.

### Code Completion and Explanation

GitHub Copilot is currently the most mature option, directly integrated into VS Code. You write a function name, it helps you complete it; you don't understand some code, copy it in and let AI explain it.

Claude and ChatGPT do a better job explaining code, especially complex logic and algorithms.

### Quickly Generating Template Code

When starting a new project, you don't need to type out the framework code yourself. Tell AI, "Write a user login and registration API using Python Flask," and it'll be done in minutes.

### Bug Fixing

Copy error messages into AI and let it help you find the problem. Many times it's faster than finding it yourself.

## Recommended Tool Combinations

| Scenario | Recommended Tool | Features |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| Code Completion | GitHub Copilot | IDE integration, real-time completion |
| Code Explanation | Claude | Strong understanding, clear explanations |
| Script Generation | ChatGPT | Can write in any language |
| Chinese Scenarios | Kimi/Baidu ERNIE | Better Chinese prompt effects |
| Free Option | Cursor | Free tier is enough for personal use |

## How to Get Started

### Option 1: Use ChatGPT or Claude Directly

No need to install anything, just register an account. Good for occasional use.

### Option 2: Install VS Code with Copilot

Recommended if you code often. VS Code is free, Copilot charges but has a free student package.

### Option 3: Use Cursor

A code editor with AI built-in, still uses the VS Code ecosystem underneath, free version is sufficient, experience is better than native VS Code+Copilot.

## For Those Worried About Being Replaced

Many people ask: Since AI writes code for me, will programmers lose their jobs?

My view is: AI can indeed write code, but it writes "implementation code," not "design code." You tell AI what you want, it gives you the implementation. But "what you want" itself requires thinking.

In the future, people who can't program might be replaced by AI, but people who can use AI won't be replaced. The key isn't how many programming languages you know, but whether you can clearly express requirements and judge whether AI's code is correct.

## Common Questions

### Q: Can AI-written code be used directly?

Basic code can be used directly, complex business code should be reviewed. AI doesn't understand your specific business scenarios.

### Q: Can someone with zero programming knowledge use this?

Yes. But you need to know how to run code. Python environment, Node.js, etc. need to be installed yourself. If it's too much trouble, use online tools like Replit, no local environment needed.

### Q: Do I need to learn English to write code?

No. Chinese prompts work well now too, but English generally works better. Depends on your needs.

### Q: Does AI programming cost money?

Depends on the tool. ChatGPT and Claude have free tiers, Copilot charges but is free for students, Cursor's free version is sufficient for personal use.
