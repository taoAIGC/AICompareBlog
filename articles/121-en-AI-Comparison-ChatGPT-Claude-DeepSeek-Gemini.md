## Introduction

I've been asked this question countless times: "Which AI is really the best?"

Honestly, every time I see this question, I want to laugh. There's no best AI, only the most suitable AI for the task. It's like asking "Which is better, Mercedes or BMW?" - it depends on what you need it for.

But I know you don't want to hear that kind of circular reasoning. So I spent a whole week torturing these four mainstream AIs with the same questions, and exposed their weaknesses.

This article doesn't talk nonsense—it's all real test data.

## Test Framework

### Test Dimensions

I set up 5 core dimensions to evaluate each AI:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Logical Reasoning | Math problems, logic puzzles, causal analysis |
| Creative Writing | Copywriting, stories, marketing plans |
| Coding Ability | Python, JavaScript, SQL |
| Chinese Understanding | Idioms, culture, context |
| Response Speed | Generation time (seconds) |

### Test Method

Same question, sent to 4 AIs simultaneously, answers recorded and compared. All tests completed on the same day, under the same network environment, to control variables as much as possible.

## Logical Reasoning Tests

### Test 1: Math Word Problem

**Question**: Xiao Ming has 5 apples, gives half to Xiao Hong, then buys 3 new ones. How many apples does Xiao Ming have now?

**Results Comparison**:

| AI | Answer | Analysis |
|----|--------|----------|
| ChatGPT | 5 | ❌ Wrong - 5÷2=2.5, then +3=5.5, rounded to 5 |
| Claude | 5.5 | ✅ Correct - detailed explanation of calculation process |
| DeepSeek | 5.5 | ✅ Correct - concise and clear |
| Gemini | 5.5 | ✅ Correct - has verification steps |

**Summary**: ChatGPT tripped up on this one, possibly because its rounding logic was too "smart." Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini all gave correct answers.

### Test 2: Logic Puzzle

**Question**: Three switches correspond to three lamps, can only enter the room once. How to determine which switch corresponds to which lamp?

**Results Comparison**:

| AI | Answer Quality | Characteristics |
|----|----------------|-----------------|
| ChatGPT | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Standard answer, clear explanation |
| Claude | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Most detailed, with diagram steps |
| DeepSeek | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Concise, but missed one detail |
| Gemini | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Standard, complete and correct |

**Summary**: Claude performed best on this type of logic question, possibly due to enhanced reasoning chains in training.

### Test 3: Causal Analysis

**Question**: Why did new energy vehicle sales growth slow down in 2024?

**Results Comparison**:

| AI | Analysis Depth | Number of Perspectives |
|----|----------------|------------------------|
| ChatGPT | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 4 angles (policy, subsidies, charging, consumer willingness) |
| Claude | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 5 angles, added "market saturation" and "price war" |
| DeepSeek | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 3 angles, but with unique perspective "consumer wait-and-see sentiment" |
| Gemini | ⭐⭐⭐ | 2 angles, relatively superficial |

**Summary**: Claude had the richest analysis dimensions, DeepSeek had unique insights, ChatGPT was standard, Gemini performed poorly.

**Logical Reasoning Winner: Claude**

## My Recommendations

### If You Can Only Choose One

**Choose Claude**.

Overall, Claude is the strongest in the two most important dimensions—logical reasoning and creative writing. Although programming is slightly inferior to ChatGPT, the gap isn't large. Moreover, Claude's Chinese understanding and expression is currently the best.

### If You Want Maximum Efficiency

**Use multi-AI comparison**.

No AI can perform best in all scenarios. My approach: open 4 AIs simultaneously, throw the same question into them, then synthesize the 4 answers and take the optimal solution.

This is also why I developed the "AI Compare" plugin—no need to switch back and forth, compare answers from 4 AIs at once.

## Summary

| AI | Characteristics | Suitable For |
|----|-----------------|--------------|
| ChatGPT | Balanced and comprehensive, strong at coding | Developers, all-around users |
| Claude | Good writing, strong reasoning | Writers, knowledge workers |
| DeepSeek | Fast and stable, good Chinese | Domestic users, technical docs |
| Gemini | Usable, but not good enough | Light users |

**Final Advice**: Don't believe in any single AI. They are all tools; it depends on how you use them.
