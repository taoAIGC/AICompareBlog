## First, the Conclusion: It Works, But You Have to Know How to Use It

I've been using AI to write copy for about half a year now.

At first I thought AI was amazing, but now I basically understand its quirks.

To be honest, AI writing copy is like having an intern on standby 24/7.

It can help you with the grunt work, but it can't make decisions for you.

## What AI Can Actually Do for Copywriting

### What It's Good At

**Writing First Drafts**

Give it a topic, give it a direction, and AI can produce a bunch of versions for you.

Then you pick the good ones and revise them.

Much faster than starting from scratch.

**Brainstorming**

Can't think of a headline? Want a few backup options?

Let AI list 10 for you, then you choose.

Better than staring at a blank screen all day.

**Rewriting and Polishing**

Finished a paragraph and it feels too dry? Let AI add some flavor.

Finished a paragraph and it feels too watery? Let AI condense it.

AI does this kind of work pretty well.

**Translation**

AI translation is much better than Google Translate.

Not that word-for-word translation, it reads like a human.

Very useful for foreign trade copy or cross-border content.

### What It's Not Good At

**Understanding Your Brand Tone**

Is your company high-end or down-to-earth?

AI doesn't know, you have to tell it.

**Coming Up with Unique Perspectives**

AI hasn't actually experienced what you've experienced.

It can only integrate existing information.

To write something with depth, you still have to do it yourself.

**Guaranteeing 100% Accuracy**

AI will confidently make things up.

You have to verify every piece of data and every fact it mentions.

## Several Pits I've Fallen Into

### Pit #1: Using It Directly Without Modifying

At first I thought AI wrote pretty well and just used it directly.

Then I got criticized after publishing.

"This doesn't sound like something you'd write," "It feels weird."

Later I revised it, and it looked much better.

Whatever AI writes, you're lucky if 80% can be used directly.

You have to revise it.

No revision, no good.

### Pit #2: Not Explaining Your Needs Clearly

"Help me write a copy" - AI doesn't know what you want.

"Help me write a promotional copy for friends targeting 25-year-old working women, should be gentle, not too hard sell" - then AI can understand it.

The more specific your needs, the better AI writes.

### Pit #3: Completely Relying on AI

Some people use AI to write articles, and every piece has that AI flavor.

Readers aren't stupid, they can tell.

AI is a tool, you are the master.

Don't let AI think for you.

### Pit #4: Not Verifying Information

The data AI says isn't necessarily correct.

The cases AI cites might not exist.

Before publishing, go check online first.

## How to Get Better Results with AI Copywriting

### Step #1: Explain Your Needs Clearly

Don't just give a topic, give context.

Who are you writing for?

What goal do you want to achieve?

Any constraints?

The more you say, the better AI understands you.

### Step #2: Try Multiple Times

The first try might not satisfy you.

Change the wording and try again.

Change the angle and try again.

AI has unlimited capacity, so trying multiple times doesn't hurt.

### Step #3: You Must Revise It

What AI writes, you're lucky if 80% can be used directly as I said.

You have to revise the opening, the ending, the logic, add examples, change wording.

After revision, it's your work.

### Step #4: Add Your Own Stuff

Add a few of your own perspectives.

Add a few cases you've experienced.

Add a bit of your personal style.

Then it reads like something you wrote.

## Which AI Tools Are Good for Copywriting

### DeepSeek

Best for Chinese copy.

What it writes sounds like a native Chinese speaker wrote it, no translation flavor.

Free, web version unlimited.

Good for WeChat articles, Zhihu answers, Xiaohongshu copy.

### ChatGPT

The veteran, can write anything.

Paid version is more powerful, but free version is also usable.

Good for multi-round conversations.

### Claude

Stronger at long-form writing.

Clear logic, good structure.

Good for article outlines, detailed plans.

## Try the AI Compare Plugin

What's the most annoying thing about writing copy?

Not knowing which AI writes better.

Same topic, three AI, three versions.

You have to try them one by one.

**AI Compare** plugin can help you save trouble.

After installing it, when you input a question, Claude, GPT, and DeepSeek answer at the same time.

You can see at a glance which version is better.

No need to open three web pages, no need to switch back and forth.

I use it to choose headlines, openings, and structures.

Saves me a lot of time.

The plugin is for Chrome, search "AI Compare" to find it.

Free, no registration needed.

Use it or not, up to you.

## Some Tips for Writing Copy

### Let AI Generate Multiple Headlines

Let AI give you 10 headlines.

You pick one, or combine the advantages of several.

Better than racking your brain for headlines yourself.

### Let AI Try the Opening

Don't know how to start an article?

Let AI write a few versions.

You pick a likable one as the opening.

### Let AI Wrap Up the Ending

Finished writing the article, can't think of how to end?

Let AI help you wrap it up.

Sometimes AI's endings are quite nice.

### Let AI Help You Find Examples

Want a few examples to support your points?

Let AI list a few for you.

Then verify them.

Use them if they're usable, find others if not.

## How Much Does AI Copywriting Cost

### Is Free Version Enough

DeepSeek is free, ChatGPT has a free version.

Enough for writing copy.

Unless you produce in large quantities, no need to spend money.

### When Should You Spend Money

Need to write dozens of articles a day?

Need a more powerful model?

Want faster speed?

Then consider paid versions.

ChatGPT Plus is $20/month, Claude Pro is $20/month.

Depends on your production needs.

## Don't Leave These to AI

**Brand Positioning** - This is your core asset, AI doesn't understand it.

**Core Perspectives** - This is your unique value, AI can't provide it.

**Real Data** - This is your credibility foundation, AI might make it up.

**Personal Experiences** - These are your exclusive stories, AI hasn't experienced them.

You have to do these yourself.

Let AI help you polish, but don't let AI help you create core content?

Don't even think about it.

## A Few Final Words

AI copywriting is a trend, people who know how to use it are indeed more efficient.

But don't treat it as a miracle solution, and don't treat it as useless trash.

It's just a tool.

Used well, it multiplies your efficiency; used poorly, it only causes trouble.

Remember a few points:

Explain needs clearly, try multiple times, definitely revise, add your own stuff.

Do these things, and AI copywriting won't be too bad.

Try it and see.
