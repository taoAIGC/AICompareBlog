## My Early Mistakes with AI

When I first started using AI, I thought I could just throw any question at it.

The results? Either too generic, completely off-topic, or a generic "I'm not sure what you need" response.

Later I realized: the problem wasn't the AI—it was that I didn't know how to ask questions properly.

Today I'm sharing 5 tips I learned from half a year of trial and error. Follow these, and your AI responses will improve dramatically.

## Why Do Your AI Responses Always Feel "Off"?

Let me clear up a misconception: the AI isn't stupid—you just weren't clear enough.

Think of AI as a highly capable employee who is **blind**. You need to feed it all the information yourself if you want the results you want.

Good prompts have three core elements:
- **Clearly state what you want**
- **Clearly state what you don't want**
- **Provide enough context**

All 5 tips below are based on these three principles.

## Tip 1: Give AI a Role/Identity

### Wrong Example
> "Help me write an article about health"

### Correct Example
> "You are a health science writer with 10 years of experience. Write an article about preventing cervical spondylosis (neck pain) in an easy-to-understand way, targeted at office workers."

**Effect Comparison:**
- Wrong: Produces a generic, superficial article
- Correct: Produces a highly targeted, engaging, and practical article

**Why It Works:**
Setting a role makes AI automatically draw from relevant "expertise," resulting in more targeted responses.

## Tip 2: Break Tasks Into Small Steps, Don't Let AI Guess

### Wrong Example
> "Analyze this product for me"

### Correct Example
> "Please analyze this product from these 3 angles:
> 1. Who is the target audience?
> 2. What are the core selling points?
> 3. Is it worth buying? (with reasons)
> Product info: [paste product description]"

**Effect Comparison:**
- Wrong: AI might ramble and miss the point
- Correct: Get a well-structured analysis that covers exactly what you need

**Why It Works:**
AI excels at executing clear tasks, not at "guessing" what you need. Breaking tasks into smaller parts = less guessing = better results.

## Tip 3: Give Examples So AI Instantly Understands Your Preference

### Wrong Example
> "Write a product description for me"

### Correct Example
> "Write a product description that meets these requirements:
> - Style: Concise and powerful, like Apple website copy
> - Length: No more than 50 words
> - Reference example: 'Think Different'—that's the vibe I'm going for"

**Effect Comparison:**
- Wrong: The style is random, possibly too formal or too casual
- Correct: AI nails exactly the style you want

**Why It Works:**
Examples are the most direct form of communication. When AI sees "Think Different," it immediately understands you want that simple, premium, attitude-driven vibe.

## Tip 4: Explicitly Tell AI What NOT to Do

### Wrong Example
> "Write a popular science article for me"

### Correct Example
> "Write a popular science article about quantum computing with these requirements:
> - Audience: High school students
> - Style: Fun and engaging
> - No: Overly technical jargon
> - No: More than 1000 words
> - No: Using formulas"

**Effect Comparison:**
- Wrong: AI might get too technical or too long
- Correct: AI actively avoids your "landmines"

**Why It Works:**
Many beginners think stating what you want is enough—but stating what you DON'T want is equally important. It's like drawing a boundary for AI.

## Tip 5: Guide Step by Step, Like Teaching an Apprentice

### Wrong Example
> "Write a Python scraper for me"

### Correct Example
> "I need to write a Python scraper. Please guide me step by step:
> Step 1: Tell me what libraries I need to install
> Step 2: Provide a simple code framework
> Step 3: Explain what each part of the code does
> Step 4: Warn me about potential pitfalls"

**Effect Comparison:**
- Wrong: AI might dump a long code block that's overwhelming
- Correct: One step at a time, every step understandable

**Why It Works:**
Giving complex tasks to AI all at once leads to unstable output quality. Breaking it down = lower difficulty = higher quality output.

## Practical Example: Creating a Quality Prompt

Using "writing a recommendation letter" as an example:

**Original Request:** Help me write a recommendation letter

**Optimized Version:**
> You are a senior HR expert. Please help me write a job recommendation letter.
> 
> Background:
> - Recommender: Zhang Manager, my former supervisor
> - Candidate: Li Ming, applying for Product Manager position
> - Work experience: 3 years
> - Key strengths: User growth, data analysis
> - Style: Formal but warm
> - Length: About 300 words
> - No: Vague praise, must include specific examples

**The difference is dramatic.**

## Advanced Tips: Use These Prompt Templates

The most frequently used templates in daily life:

### 1. Role + Task + Requirements
> "You are a [professional role], please help me [specific task], with [specific requirements]"

### 2. Background + Task + Output Format
> "[Background info], please help me [task], output in [table/list/paragraph] format"

### 3. Example + Imitate + Adjust
> "Following the [style/structure/tone] of the example below, help me write [content], with these adjustments: [your changes]"

## Final Thoughts

The essence of a good prompt is: **translating your needs into language AI can understand.**

AI is not human—it can't "guess" what you're thinking. The clearer you are, the better it performs.

You don't need to memorize all 5 tips. Just remember the core principle: **treat AI as an employee who has never seen what's in your head—put everything in the prompt.**

After enough practice, you'll realize: the same AI becomes a completely different tool in different people's hands.
