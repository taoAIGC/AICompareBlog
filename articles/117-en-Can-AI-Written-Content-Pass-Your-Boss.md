## That Friday Afternoon, I Almost Quit

Last year at this time, I was working as a copywriter at an e-commerce company.

At 4:50 PM, my boss walked to my desk and dropped this bombshell: "I need the Double 11 promotional copy on my desk by 10 AM tomorrow. Make it fresh, avoid clichés."

My only thought: Here we go again.

I'd written Double 11 copy more than 30 times. Every time it was the same formula: excitement, limited-time offers, exclusive deals... and my boss was never satisfied.

But this time, I was truly out of ideas.

## I Decided to Take a Risk

At 9 PM, I sat in my rental apartment and opened ChatGPT, typing:

"Write me a Double 11 e-commerce copy that's fresh and avoids clichés."

Ten seconds later, the screen lit up.

To be honest, it was... okay. But it had that unmistakable "textbook answer" vibe. Like a perfect exam essay — flawless, but soulless.

I tried Claude. The writing was better, but too literary for e-commerce.

Then I tried DeepSeek. The logic was clear, but not engaging enough.

That's when it hit me: the answer from any single AI is always "one-dimensional."

## My Method: Let AIs "Copy" Each Other

I'm not a professional, but I came up with a simple approach:

Put answers from 3 AIs side by side and compare them paragraph by paragraph.

ChatGPT's opening was too plain, so I replaced it with Claude's hook. DeepSeek's promotional logic was well-structured, so I kept that part. ChatGPT's ending was too generic, so I swapped it for something more compelling...

The final result, honestly, didn't sound like any single person wrote it.

The next morning at 9 AM, I sent it to my boss with trembling hands.

At 10:02 AM, my boss replied with a single word: "Good."

Then added: "This one's actually interesting."

I nearly jumped out of my chair.

## Why a Single AI Isn't Enough

After thinking about it, I realized something.

Each AI has its own "personality":

- **ChatGPT**: The reliable straight-A student — flawless work but no surprises
- **Claude**: The literary type — great writing but sometimes too pretentious
- **DeepSeek**: The logic monster — clear structure but lacks human warmth
- **Kimi**: Natural Chinese expressions but lacks depth

Ask any one of them to work alone, and you get a 70-point answer at best.

But if you have all four write simultaneously and you act as the "editor," picking the best parts from each answer, you can piece together a 90-point copy.

That's the lesson I learned: **AI doesn't replace you — it helps you test options.**

## Practical Guide: How to Piece Together Great Copy

### Step 1: Don't Just Ask One Question

Most people use it wrong. They only say: "Help me write copy."

Try this instead:

"Write me 3 versions of Double 11 copy in different styles: one emotional and heartfelt, one rational focused on deals, one youthful and using memes."

Now you get 3 different directions at once.

### Step 2: Compare Every Part's Strengths

After getting answers from 4 AIs, don't rush to choose.

Open Excel or a notes app and create 4 columns — one for each AI's answer.

Then compare paragraph by paragraph:

- Whose opening hook is most engaging?
- Whose logic is clearest in the middle?
- Whose call-to-action converts best?

Pick and choose, then assemble your own version.

### Step 3: Add Some "Human Flavor"

No matter how good AI-written content is, it has one problem: it's too "clean."

You need to add something "messy" — personal expression.

It could be your verbal tics, company jargon, or an inside joke only you know.

AI can never replicate these things, but adding them brings the whole copy to life.

## Your Most Asked Questions

**Q: Will AI-written content be detected?**

Honestly, if you copy-paste directly, your boss or readers will notice. AI-written content has that "too polished" feel, like something from a corporate training program.

But if you've edited, added to, and restructured it yourself — that's called "editing," not AI ghostwriting.

**Q: How do I make it sound less like AI?**

A few tips:

1. Break long sentences into shorter ones — AI loves long sentences to sound sophisticated
2. Add casual words like "Honestly..." or "You know what I mean..."
3. Remove transition phrases like "In conclusion..." or "As we can see..."
4. Include specific numbers, cases, details

**Q: My English isn't great. How do I use Claude and ChatGPT?**

Chinese AIs are actually quite strong now. DeepSeek, Kimi, and Doubao's Chinese expressions are very natural — not worse than foreign ones.

Many plugins also support one-click language switching — ask in Chinese, get Chinese answers.

## How Do Real Pros Use AI?

I talked to a few friends in marketing and found they use AI in one consistent way: **never as a ghostwriter, always as a consultant.**

What do I mean?

They don't ask AI to write complete copy directly. Instead, they ask AI to:

- Help me think of 3 different angles
- Help me diagnose what's wrong with this paragraph
- Help me find 10 competitor slogans as references
- Help me make this paragraph more conversational

In other words, not giving direct answers — but giving options, suggestions, and modification directions.

Used this way, AI is never "detected" because it's always "assisting," never "replacing."

## Something Real

I know many copywriters have complicated feelings about AI.

They love that it boosts efficiency, but fear becoming "useless."

But here's what I want to say: AI's greatest strength isn't writing — it's **testing options**.

It can give you 10 versions in one second, and you just need to pick one and edit one.

Humans will never match that capability.

But the final decision will always be yours.

Your taste, your judgment, your understanding of the business — AI can never learn these.

So don't fear AI replacing you.

Fear your colleague using it while you don't.

**One final thought**:

AI won't make you lose your job. But someone who uses AI will make someone who doesn't lose their job.
