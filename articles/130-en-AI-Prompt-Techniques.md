## Same AI, Different People, Worlds Apart Results

I have a friend who started using ChatGPT at the same time as me.

Three months later, he said: "AI is nothing special. Not that useful."

Me: ???

I looked at his chat history and almost passed out.

His questions to ChatGPT looked like this:
> "Help me write an article"

Mine looked like this:
> "I'm a frontend developer who needs to write a React tutorial for beginners. The target readers are people with no prior frontend experience. About 2000 words. Keep the tone light and humorous, use plenty of metaphors. Give me the complete article in markdown format."

The result? He got "watered-down content," I got "viral articles."

The problem? **Prompts.**

## What Is a Prompt? In Plain Terms: How You Ask

A prompt is what you say to AI.

Sounds simple, but 90% of people don't know how to "ask."

Here are the most common pitfalls:

### Pitfall 1: Too Vague

> "Help me write copy"

AI: ??? What product? For whom? What tone? How long?

### Pitfall 2: Missing Context

> "Analyze this market"

AI: ??? Which market? What data? For who?

### Pitfall 3: Unclear Expectations

> "Give me some suggestions"

AI: ??? What kind of suggestions? Career? Relationships? Investment?

AI can answer these questions - but if you don't clarify, it guesses, and when it guesses wrong, you get garbage.

## 5 Core Elements of Good Prompts

I spent a month changing my prompting habits.

Now I get 80% satisfactory results in one go.

### 1. Identity: Who Are You

Tell AI who you are, so it can use the right tone and perspective.

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Analyze this project's risks"

**✅ Right**:
> "I'm a product manager considering entrepreneurship. Analyze this project's risks from an investor's perspective."

### 2. Background: What Problem Are You Solving

Give AI context so it understands your situation.

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Help me write a resume"

**✅ Right**:
> "I have 5 years of e-commerce operations experience and am job hunting for a user growth position. I need a resume highlighting data analysis skills."

### 3. Task: What Exactly Should It Do

The more specific, the less likely AI veers off course.

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Give me some suggestions"

**✅ Right**:
> "Give me 5 specific strategies to improve user retention, each with implementation steps and expected outcomes."

### 4. Format: What Should the Output Look Like

Tell AI the output format and save yourself processing time.

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Introduce Python"

**✅ Right**:
> "Compare Python and JavaScript across 5 core dimensions in a table format: syntax, use cases, performance, learning difficulty, ecosystem."

### 5. Constraints: What Shouldn't It Do

Add restrictions for more precise answers.

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Write product description"

**✅ Right**:
> "Write a smart watch product description, no more than 100 words, emphasizing sleep tracking features, avoiding hyperbolic words like 'revolutionary' or 'leading.'"

## My Go-To Prompt Templates

Explain the core concepts in the simplest, most understandable way.
Give 3 practical application scenarios.
Recommend 1 entry-level resource.
Keep the tone lively and interesting, not too academic.
```

## Different AI, Different Prompting Approaches

I've used over a dozen AIs and found a pattern: **different AIs have different personalities.**

### ChatGPT

- Prefers structured, clear instructions
- Responds better to English prompts
- Excellent for creative tasks

### Claude

- Strong long-form processing
- Likes role-playing prompts
- Great at analysis tasks

### DeepSeek

- Excellent Chinese understanding
- Doesn't need complex prompts
- Strong on code and logic

### Kimi

- Good multi-turn conversation
- Remembers earlier context in long conversations
- Strong file analysis

## Advanced Technique: Make AI "Think" Before Answering

For some questions, asking directly doesn't work well.

Add this line:
> "Please think about this first, then give me your answer"

Or more advanced:
> "Please approach this in three steps: Step 1 - analyze the problem's essence; Step 2 - list possible solutions; Step 3 - give final recommendation"

This works especially well for:
- Questions requiring logical reasoning
- Questions requiring creative brainstorming
- Decisions requiring trade-offs

## My Hard-Learned Lessons

### Lesson 1: Don't Be Attached to Conversations

AI has "memory fatigue." Long conversations, and it "forgets" earlier content.

My approach: New task, new conversation.

### Lesson 2: Have It Confirm Understanding First

For complex tasks, I ask first:
> "Please restate my requirements to confirm you understand"

Once confirmed, then proceed.

### Lesson 3: Multiple Iterations Are Normal

Don't expect perfect answers from AI in one shot.

My standard workflow:
1. Round 1: Get framework/outline
2. Round 2: Fill in content
3. Round 3: Refine details

Usually get satisfactory results within 3 rounds.

## Conclusion: AI Is a Tool, You're the Driver

After using AI for almost a year, my biggest realization is:

**No matter how powerful AI is, it's just a tool. How useful the tool is depends on the person using it.**

Same ChatGPT - someone can earn 100K a month with it, others think "it's nothing special."

The difference isn't AI - it's **whether you know how to ask.**

Once you learn good prompting:
- AI doesn't just help you "slack off," it helps you "think"
- It's not that AI is dumb, it's that you weren't clear
- Good prompts = good communication = efficient results

From today, before every AI conversation, ask yourself:
"Did I make myself clear?"
