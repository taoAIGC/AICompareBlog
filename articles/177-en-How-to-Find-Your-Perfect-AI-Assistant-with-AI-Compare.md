## Ask Yourself a Question First

Which AI do you use right now?

ChatGPT? Claude? Or maybe you have several open at once, just to compare their answers?

Honestly, that's exhausting.

Opening a bunch of tabs, switching back and forth, asking the same question multiple times. Sometimes you ask ChatGPT and forget to ask Claude, then have to copy-paste everything again when you remember.

**Ever thought: what if you could type once and see all AI answers at the same time?**

That's exactly what the AI Compare plugin solves.

## One Tab, Multiple AIs Compared

After installing AI Compare, you just need to:

1. Hit the shortcut key (Cmd+M on Mac, Ctrl+M on Windows)
2. Type in your question
3. Check the AI sites you want to compare
4. Click confirm

Then? Then you see ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Kimi, Doubao... all in one page.

Side by side. Clear as day.

No switching tabs. No retyping. No forgetting to ask one.

## Real Scenario: Writing a Job Application Email

Let me give you a personal example.

I was helping a friend review their resume, and they wanted to know how to write a more professional job application email. I used AI Compare to ask several AIs at once:

**Question:** "I'm a Java developer with 3 years of experience, applying for a backend position at ByteDance. Help me write a job application email, highlighting my distributed systems and microservices experience."

I checked ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Doubao.

A few seconds later, all four answers appeared:

- ChatGPT had a standard structure, but felt a bit templated
- Claude sounded more natural, giving off "this person knows their stuff"
- DeepSeek had specific data, but the opening was a bit stiff
- Doubao's Chinese expressions were the most natural, but with fewer details

If I asked one by one, it might have taken 5-10 minutes. Now? 30 seconds done.

In the end, I combined the best parts from each AI to help my friend revise, and the result was better than any single AI's output alone.

## Not Just Comparison, But One-Click Opening

AI Compare isn't just a comparison tool.

It can also one-click open your favorite AI sites.

What does that mean?

For example, if you mainly use ChatGPT daily but sometimes need Claude's coding abilities or DeepSeek's Chinese understanding, you don't need to hunt for the websites—just click in the plugin and it opens.

Supported mainstream AI sites include:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- DeepSeek
- Perplexity
- Kimi
- Doubao
- POE
- Gemini
- And more

You can configure your favorite sites yourself, compare as many as you want.

## Word Selection Query: Select Text and Ask

Here's another feature I use all the time.

When reading online and you see some code or text you don't quite understand, just select it, right-click "Let AI help me check," then choose which AI to use. A new tab opens directly, saving you the copy-paste step.

Especially useful when reading English documentation.

## Completely Free, No Registration Needed

After talking about all these features, what about the price?

**Free.**

No account registration, no usage limits, no paid memberships.

The developer said they built this plugin to help more people easily compare AI results, not to make money.

Free users rejoice.
