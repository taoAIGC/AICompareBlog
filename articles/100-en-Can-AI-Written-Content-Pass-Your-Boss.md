## Opening: That Friday Afternoon, AI Almost Got Me Fired

Last Friday at 4:50 PM, my boss dropped a document on me: "Write a product promotion article. Due tomorrow morning at 10 AM."

I froze completely.

Never seen this product before. Know nothing about this industry. 5000 words. Due tomorrow morning.

Normally I'd be pulling an all-nighter,疯狂Googling and piecing things together. But this time, I decided to try AI.

Guess what happened?

First draft took only 20 minutes, but after reading it twice, something felt off — it was too "perfect." Too polished. Not something a human would write.

My boss glanced at it and said: "What is this? It smells like AI. Rewrite it."

I died inside.

Then I realized: it's not that AI doesn't work. It's that I don't know how to use it properly.

Using just one AI produces generic, template-like content. But if you use 4 AIs simultaneously, compare their outputs, and pick the best from each — the results are completely different.

This article shares my实战经验: **How to use AI to write something your boss can't criticize.**

## Why Does AI Output Always Smell "Too AI-Like"?

Have you noticed AI-written content usually has these characteristics:

**First, too structured.** Opening with "First... Second... Finally," ending with "In conclusion..." This rigid structure is rarely used in human writing.

**Second, too comprehensive.** Covers everything, says a little about everything, but essentially says nothing. Your boss wants "highlights," not "everything."

**Third, too "fancy."** Full of buzzwords like "empowerment," "touchpoints," "closed loops." Reads like memorization.

Why does this happen?

Because AI training data is full of these "standard answers." AI doesn't know your boss's preferred style. It only knows "what most people consider good writing."

Worse, if you use only one AI, you get "single-style" output. You think you're using AI, but you're actually having "one person" do the work.

This is the problem.

## My Method: Ask 4 AIs Simultaneously, Pick the Best, Then Combine

I learned the hard way.

My AI writing workflow now: **One input, 4 AIs answer at the same time, compare outputs, combine the best parts.**

Here's how:

### Step 1: Clarify Your Core Needs

Before making AI work, ask yourself three questions:

1. What's the purpose of this copy? (Sell product? Brand awareness?)
2. Who is the target reader? (B2B customers? Young users?)
3. What do you most want readers to remember? (One feature? One concept?)

Write down your "requirements list" based on these three questions.

### Step 2: Ask 4 AIs Simultaneously

Feed the requirements to the AI Compare plugin, ask ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Kimi simultaneously.

Key point here: **Ask the same question, but have AI assume different roles.**

For example:
- Let ChatGPT take the "professional route" with solid data support
- Let Claude take the "literary route" with vivid language
- Let DeepSeek take the "logical route" with clear structure
- Let Kimi take the "conversational route" without clichés

### Step 3: Compare 4 Answers and Extract the Best Parts

This is the most crucial step.

Open 4 AI responses and compare horizontally:

| AI | Opening | Strength | Weakness |
|----|---------|----------|----------|
| ChatGPT | Too formal | Rich data | Lacks human touch |
| Claude | Poetic | Beautiful sentences | Too literary, not direct enough |
| DeepSeek | Logical | Good structure | A bit dry |
| Kimi | Down-to-earth | Sounds like real person | Lacks depth |

Then start "building with LEGOs."

Use Claude's opening (has imagery), DeepSeek's middle section (has logic), ChatGPT's case studies (has data), Kimi's conclusion (has punchline).

After this combination, it starts reading more like "human-written."

## Practical Case: How to Write Product Copy Using 4 AIs

Let me demonstrate with a specific case.

**Background**: New smartwatch launch, need to write a promotional article.

**Requirements**:
- Target users: 25-35 year old professionals
- Core selling points: 7-day battery life, health monitoring, great value
- Writing tone: Relaxed, professional, not too salesy

### Round 1: Ask 4 AIs Simultaneously

**ChatGPT's version:**
> "This smartwatch is designed for modern professionals seeking efficiency. 7-day ultra-long battery life means charging is no longer a burden. Advanced health monitoring technology protects your health in real-time. Compared to similar products, the value is superior. Experience it now and embrace a new smart life."

**Claude's version:**
> "Imagine waking up in the morning without worrying about charging your watch. It accompanies you quietly for 7 days, from morning runs to late nights, from meetings to quiet moments. It's not just a timepiece — it's a guardian of your health. At a more friendly price, technology truly serves life."

**DeepSeek's** version:
> "Core selling points: 1. 7-day battery life, solves charging anxiety; 2. All-day health monitoring, heart rate/oxygen/sleep fully covered; 3. Same features, 20% lower price. Applicable scenarios: fitness, work, daily wear."

**Kimi's version:**
> "Honestly, the smartwatches I used before needed charging every two days — it was annoying. This one with 7-day battery life is really great. Charges once a week, that's it. Health monitoring has everything you need, and the price is cheaper. Recommended for fellow workers who hate hassle like me."

### Round 2: Compare and Combine

After reviewing these four versions, I made the following combination:

**Opening: Claude's** (has imagery, not cliché)
> "Imagine waking up in the morning without worrying about charging your watch."

**Middle sections: ChatGPT's** (data support, seems professional)
> "7-day ultra-long battery life means charging is no longer a burden."

**Feature descriptions: DeepSeek's** (clear structure, easy to understand)
> "All-day health monitoring, heart rate, oxygen, sleep — everything covered."

**Conclusion: Kimi's** (relatable, has resonance)
> "Honestly, 7-day battery life is amazing. Charges once a week is enough. Recommended for workers who hate hassle like me."

### Round 3: Manual Polish

Finally, I combined these fragments, read it twice, adjusted transitions, and made it flow like one person wrote it.

Final version:
> "Imagine waking up in the morning without worrying about charging your watch. From morning runs to late nights, from meetings to quiet moments, it accompanies you quietly for 7 days. This smartwatch's all-day health monitoring — heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep tracking — has everything you need, and it only needs charging once a week. Honestly, battery anxiety is something you understand only after experiencing it. At a more accessible price, technology truly serves life. Recommended for workers who hate hassle like me."

After reading it, my boss said: "This is acceptable. There's improvement."

Not exactly earth-shattering praise, but at least I didn't have to rewrite it.

## 3 Questions You Might Ask

**Q1: Won't this leak company information?**

A1: Depends. If you're writing highly confidential product info, I'd recommend desensitizing core information first. For example, change "our A technology" to "industry-leading technology," or only show AI publicly available product information.

**Q2: Isn't this less efficient? Originally 20 minutes, now it takes an hour?**

A2: It is slower initially, but there are benefits: 1) You learn to "command" AI rather than being "commanded" by AI; 2) Higher output quality means fewer revision rounds later; 3) After forming your own workflow, speed improves significantly.

**Q3: Where can I use this function?**

A3: The easiest way is to install an "AI Compare" browser plugin. Press `Ctrl+M` (Windows) or `Cmd+M` (Mac) to launch, open 4 AIs at once, and compare outputs. Currently completely free, no registration needed.

## Summary

AI-written content smells "too AI-like" not because AI is bad, but because you're only using one AI.

Using multiple AIs simultaneously, comparing outputs, and picking the best from each — this is the correct approach.

Don't let AI write for you. Let AI help you "enrich your material library."

At the end of the day, AI is just a tool. The person using the tool is you. Your boss wants "human language," not "machine language."
