## Why More and More Programmers Are Using AI to Write Code

Honestly, when I first heard about "using AI to write code," I was skeptical. As someone who's been coding for over a decade, I've always believed code should be written by yourself—what could AI possibly produce?

But then I noticed more and more colleagues starting to use AI-assisted programming, and their efficiency was noticeably improved. After trying it for a few months, I have to admit, it's pretty good. Today, let's talk about AI programming.

## Recommended AI Programming Tools

| Tool | Use Case | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| GitHub Copilot | Daily coding | IDE integration, real-time completion |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Algorithm ideas | Explains concepts, provides approaches |
|Cursor | Full-process development | AI-first editor |
|Kimi/Tongyi Qianwen | Chinese scenarios | Good Chinese understanding, generous free tier |

## Practical AI Programming Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Writing Repetitive Code

Tasks like data validation, format conversion, CRUD interfaces—AI writes these faster and better than most junior programmers. You just describe the requirements, and it generates usable code.

### Scenario 2: Debug and Error Resolution

When you encounter error messages, just throw the logs to AI. It helps locate issues and analyze causes much faster than reading logs yourself.

### Scenario 3: Learning New Technologies

When learning a new language or framework, having AI explain code and give examples is much more efficient than reading documentation.

### Scenario 4: Writing Test Cases

Writing unit tests is tedious but necessary. AI can automatically generate test cases; you just need to verify them.

## Correct Ways to Use AI Programming

### Step 1: Learn to State Requirements

How much AI can help largely depends on how you describe your needs. Don't just say "write a sorting algorithm for me"—say "write a quicksort algorithm in Python, handling empty lists and duplicate elements, with O(nlogn) time complexity."

### Step 2: Verify AI Output

AI-generated code isn't always 100% correct—always run it on your machine to ensure logic is correct and edge cases are handled.

### Step 3: Understand the Code Logic

Don't just copy-paste; read through the code and understand how it works. This way, you can solve similar problems yourself next time.

## Efficiency Improvement

Based on my experience, AI-assisted programming provides these improvements:

- **Coding speed**: 40%-60% improvement
- **Debugging time**: 50%+ savings
- **Learning curve**: Much smoother

## Common Questions

### Q: Will AI make me stupider?
A: It depends on how you use it. If you rely entirely on AI without thinking, you'll definitely get lazy. If you use it for assistance with learning and repetitive work, you're freeing up your time to focus on more complex problems.

### Q: Can AI code go directly to production?
A: Better not. AI-generated code needs human review, especially for security, performance, and edge cases.

### Q: Will company code be leaked?
A: GitHub Copilot and similar tools are continuously improving their data handling policies. For sensitive code, use locally deployed solutions or anonymize before using.
