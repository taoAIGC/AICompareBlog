## Let Me Tell You Something

I have a friend who loves to complain to me about AI.

"This AI is so dumb, I asked it to write a proposal and gave me garbage."

"It's useless, I ask it questions and it answers completely wrong."

"I see online people saying how great AI is, but why is it so useless for me?"

Later I looked at his conversations with AI.

I asked him three words: "What are you doing?"

Can you blame AI for being confused?

## Where's the Problem?

90% of people who can't use AI well, the problem isn't AI.

It's that you don't know how to ask.

Do you think AI is a mind reader?

How would it know what's in your head?

You have to tell it.

Clearly.

In detail.

It's not a mind reader, but it's your 24-hour assistant.

If you don't explain clearly, how can it work?

## What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is what you say to AI.

Professionally called Prompt.

Simply put, it's the command you give AI.

For the same task, if you explain clearly, AI can do it perfectly.

If you speak vaguely, AI will only give you vague results.

Don't blame AI, blame yourself first.

## What Does a Good Prompt Look Like?

### Example One

**Bad way**: "Help me write a proposal."

**Good way**: "Help me write a marketing plan for a skincare product targeting working women aged 25-35, budget 50,000, goal is WeChat public account seeding, need 3 touchpoints, style should be premium, not too salesy."

See? Same task of writing a proposal.

First way, AI doesn't know what to write.

Second way, AI knows which direction to go.

### Example Two

**Bad way**: "Help me optimize this text."

**Good way**: "Rewrite this product description to be more conversational, target readers are regular consumers, avoid too much jargon, highlight cost-performance ratio, keep it under 200 words."

Optimize what?

Optimize to what style?

Who is the target reader?

What are the constraints?

Explain clearly, AI can give you what you want.

## Tips for Writing Good Prompts

### Tip One: Give Context

AI isn't a mind reader.

You need to give background information.

Who are you?

Who are you writing for?

What goal do you want to achieve?

You need to say these.

Example: "I'm a beauty blogger, writing a Xiaohongshu post recommending an affordable essence, targeting fans aged 18-25 college students, language should be relaxed and humorous, not too formal."

### Tip Two: Give Constraints

Without constraints, AI tends to go wild.

Word count limits.

Style limits.

Format limits.

Output limits.

Example: "Write 3 WeChat Moments captions, each under 50 characters, need emojis, should be conversational, not too ad-like."

### Tip Three: Give Examples

Don't know how to explain clearly?

Show AI a few examples.

"Write 3 new ones in this style" — much easier than describing the style yourself.

### Tip Four: Break It Down

Complex tasks in steps.

First, let AI do version one.

After reviewing, say what needs changing.

Then let AI revise to version two.

Don't dump all requirements at once.

AI can't remember them all, and you can't review them all.

### Tip Five: Iterate More

First try unsatisfactory? That's normal.

Try again with different wording.

Try again from a different angle.

AI has unlimited capacity, no loss in trying more times.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake One: Asking Too Vague

"Help me write something" — who can help with that?

You need to say what to write, for whom, and for what purpose.

### Mistake Two: Expecting Too Much

AI isn't a god.

It can't think for you.

It can't know your secret recipe.

It can only work within the framework you give.

### Mistake Three: Only Asking Once

Unsatisfied after one question and giving up?

Try a different way to ask.

Try a different angle.

You need multiple rounds with colleagues too, right?

Why can't you chat more with AI?

### Mistake Four: Not Making Revisions

Using AI's output directly?

You're too confident.

Did you verify everything AI said?

Does AI's writing match your brand tone?

You still need to revise.

### Mistake Five: Not Speaking Naturally

Some people are super polite to AI.

"Dear AI master, I humbly request..."

Totally unnecessary.

Just talk normally.

Treat AI as an intern, don't worship it.

## How to Write Prompts for Different Scenarios

### Writing Articles

"Write an article about xxx, xxx words, target readers are xxx, style is xxx, should include xxx case studies."

### Writing Copy

"Write a Xiaohongshu/WeChat Moments/Douyin post about xxx, highlight xxx, xxx characters, in xxx style."

### Translation

"Translate this Chinese text into English, should read naturally for native English speakers, not literal translation."

### Brainstorming

"Give me 10 ideas/titles/directions about xxx, should be innovative, not too common."

### Rewriting

"Rewrite this text to be more xxx (conversational/concise/professional/funny), target readers are xxx."

### Summarizing

"Summarize the key points of this text, in bullet points, concise, no more than 5 points."

## Advanced Tips

### Role Setting

Give AI a role.

"You are a beauty editor with 10 years of experience" — what it writes will be different.

"You are a senior product manager" — perspective will be different.

### Step-by-Step Guidance

Complex tasks in steps.

First step, let AI do what.

Second step, let AI do what.

Third step, let AI do what.

Each step has a clear goal.

### Feedback on Results

Tell AI when it does well.

"This headline is good, use this one."

Tell AI when it doesn't do well.

"Too long, cut it in half."

"Too formal, make it conversational."

It will learn.

### Save Templates

Save good prompts that work.

Use them next time.

No need to write from scratch each time.

Build your own prompt library.

## Try the AI Compare Plugin

Wrote a prompt but unsure about the effect?

Throw the same prompt to three AIs and see.

**AI Compare** plugin can help you test.

Claude, GPT, DeepSeek answer at the same time.

You can instantly see which AI understands your prompt better.

Which version has higher quality.

No need to switch between three tabs.

Plugin is for Chrome, search "AI Compare" to find it.

Free, no registration needed.

Try it and see.

## A Few Personal Insights

### Don't Be Afraid to Ask

Ask wrong, then ask again.

Ask clearly before continuing.

AI won't get annoyed with you.

### Don't Expect to Get It Right the First Time

Trying multiple times is normal.

Adjust a little each time.

Gradually you'll get closer to the result.

### You Still Have to Do Your Part

AI can help polish.

AI can help expand.

But core insights, unique stories, brand tone — you have to provide these yourself.

AI is an amplifier, not a replacement.

### Learn from Others' Prompts

There are many prompt sharing online.

See how others ask.

Learn from them.

Make them your own.

## Final Thoughts

AI, when used well, is a powerful tool.

When used poorly, it's just decoration.

The difference is whether you know how to ask.

Those who know how to ask, AI works for them.

Those who don't, just stare at AI blankly.

Learn some prompt engineering skills.

An hour is enough to get started.

A few tries and you'll get the feeling.

Don't just read, practice.

Open AI and try one prompt.
