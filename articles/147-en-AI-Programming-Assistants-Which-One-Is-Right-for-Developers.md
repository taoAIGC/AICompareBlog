## Why Do Programmers Need AI Programming Assistants?

As a developer, I used to think coding was something pretty "independent" - put on my headphones, stare at the screen, type line by line. But then I noticed many of my colleagues started using AI programming assistants, and they were clearly much faster with fewer bugs.

Honestly, I was resistant at first. Always felt like letting AI write code for me was like cheating. But after giving it a try, I found it was actually pretty great.

AI programming assistants aren't here to replace programmers - they're here to handle those repetitive, mundane coding tasks. The real core logic still depends on you.

## Mainstream AI Programming Assistants on the Market Compared

### 1. GitHub Copilot

This is probably the most well-known one, from Microsoft, deeply integrated with GitHub.

**Pros**:
- Strong code completion, especially for popular languages
- Great integration with VS Code and JetBrains全家桶
- Has an enterprise version, good for teams

**Cons**:
- Subscription-based, not cheap
- Average support for Chinese comments
- Sometimes the generated code needs checking, there might be pitfalls

### 2. Cursor

This is an editor specifically designed for AI programming, based on VS Code.

**Pros**:
- Free version is sufficient, pro version is affordable
- AI chat functionality is powerful, can understand the context of the entire project
- Supports multi-file editing, which is very convenient

**Cons**:
- As a standalone editor, some people might not get used to it
- Not as rich an ecosystem as VS Code
- Occasionally has some minor bugs

### 3. Kimi Code (ByteDance)

A domestic player, focusing on Chinese scenarios.

**Pros**:
- Strong Chinese understanding, friendly to Chinese comments
- Free quota is quite generous
- Fast access speed in China

**Cons**:
- Compared to Copilot and Cursor, features are still not complete enough
- Mainly suitable for frontend and simple scripts, support for complex projects is average

### 4. Doubao Code Assistant

Another domestic option, free to use.

**Pros**:
- Completely free, which is very attractive
- Friendly to domestic environment, stable access

**Cons**:
- Features are still quite basic
- Limited advanced functionality
- Suitable for beginners, not for professional developers

## My Usage Experience and Suggestions

I currently use Copilot and Cursor together.

When writing code, Copilot handles auto-completion, which is fast. When I need to refactor or understand complex logic, I switch to Cursor and use its chat feature to help me analyze and generate code.

If you're a beginner and want to try AI programming first, you can start with Doubao or Kimi Code to get a feel for it. After getting familiar, then consider Copilot or Cursor.

If you're working on commercial projects, I'd recommend Copilot - the enterprise version has code audit functionality, making it more reassuring to use.

## How to Get Started Quickly?

### Step 1: Choose One Tool to Start

Don't be greedy, stick with one first until you're comfortable with it.

### Step 2: Learn to Ask Good Questions

The core of AI programming is the prompt. The more specific your question, the more accurate the answer.

For example:
- ❌ "Help me write a login feature"
- ✅ "Write a user login API using Python + Flask, including username and password verification, need to return JWT token"

### Step 3: Maintain a Skeptical Attitude

Always read the AI-generated code yourself, understand it, and then use it. There really are pitfalls - I've fallen into them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will AI programming assistants replace programmers?**

Not in the short term. AI can help you write code, but it can't help you with architectural design, requirements understanding, or business decisions. The core value of programmers isn't the speed of typing code, but the ability to solve problems.

**Q: Will using AI programming assistants affect learning?**

It depends on how you use it. If you completely rely on AI and don't think for yourself, it will indeed affect growth. But if you use it to accelerate learning and verify ideas, then it's a good thing. The key is that you still need to take action and think for yourself.

**Q: Which AI programming assistant is the best?**

There's no "best," only what's most suitable. I recommend trying the free version first, getting a feel for which one feels more natural to use, and then deciding whether to pay.

## Efficiency Improvement Effects

Using myself as an example, after using AI programming assistants:

- **Coding speed improvement**: 40%-60% (mainly reducing repetitive work)
- **Bug reduction**: 30%-40% (especially low-level bugs like typos and type errors)
- **Learning efficiency improvement**: 50% (when encountering unfamiliar frameworks, can quickly generate example code to learn)

## Summary

AI programming assistants are tools. Used well, they can significantly improve efficiency. Used poorly, they can become a burden.

My suggestion: Pick one, stick with it, use it deeply. Don't try this today and that tomorrow, and end up not being familiar with any of them.
