## You're Not Alone

4:47 PM. Your boss drops a message in the group chat: "This proposal doesn't work. Rewrite it."

You stare at the blinking cursor on your blank document, mind completely blank. This is already the 6th version you've rewritten today, and the deadline is 9 AM tomorrow.

You open ChatGPT, type in your request, and 5 seconds later get a piece of text that looks pretty good. You make a few edits and submit it.

Your boss glances at it: "This sounds like AI wrote it. Too template-y."

Your heart sinks.

## Why This Happens

Relying on a single AI tool really does make it hard to deliver directly.

ChatGPT's strength is speed and consistency, but its output is often "too correct" – well-structured and properly worded, but missing that bit of "human touch." Bosses who read hundreds of emails and dozens of proposals every day are immune to this assembly-line style.

Even worse, if you only use one AI, your output will match countless others. When 5 people in an office are all using ChatGPT to write weekly reports, the boss can tell at a glance.

That's why more and more people are starting to "mix multiple AIs" – not out of laziness, but to give themselves a safety net.

## My Method: 4 AIs Taking Turns

I've tried a method that works pretty well: feed one AI's output into another AI for reprocessing.

**Step 1: Have ChatGPT draft the first version**
Its strength is complete structure and coverage. Let it give you a basic framework first – whether it's good or bad, at least you have something.

**Step 2: Have Claude rewrite it**
Claude's writing is more delicate and natural. Take the dry content from ChatGPT and hand it to Claude to convert it into "human language."

**Step 3: Have DeepSeek check the logic**
Domestic models sometimes understand Chinese workplace context better than foreign ones. It helps you turn those "translation vibes" into more authentic expressions.

**Step 4: Human finishing touch**
Finally, read it yourself, add 1-2 real cases, change 1-2 word choices. This step can't be skipped – AI can help you, but you need to sign off at the end.

## Real Case: A Rejected Proposal

Last week I helped a friend revise a product proposal. He's a programmer who was suddenly asked by his boss to write a client-facing technical solution.

He wrote 2 versions himself using ChatGPT, and both got rejected. The reason? "Too technical, clients won't understand."

I suggested he use a comparison tool to send the same request to 4 AIs simultaneously:

- ChatGPT gave a well-structured but somewhat dry version
- Claude's version had better writing but was a bit too "literary"
- DeepSeek's version was logically clear but the examples were too basic
- Kimi's version was average, but had a few surprisingly accurate phrases

He combined Claude's way of expression, DeepSeek's logical framework, and Kimi's precise phrasing, then added 2 real customer cases himself.

This time his boss said: "This works."

## Tool Recommendation: Less Switching, More Comparing

If you have to open 4 websites and log into 4 accounts every time, it's really annoying.

There's an easier way: use a browser plugin that aggregates multiple AIs. Enter your question once, get answers from 4 AIs at the same time, then compare them on one screen and pick the best parts to combine.

This way you don't have to switch between tabs repeatedly or log into multiple accounts. One input box, 4 answers, compare while you select.

The time you save – wouldn't you rather have a coffee?

## Final Words

Using AI to write isn't about plagiarizing – it's like hiring an intern to help you with the work. You still need to review and edit what an intern submits, same with AI.

The key is not to dump all the work on one AI. Ask several, compare several, then pick the best parts, combine them, and polish them up – that's real efficiency improvement.

Don't let AI think for you, but let AI help you express yourself.
