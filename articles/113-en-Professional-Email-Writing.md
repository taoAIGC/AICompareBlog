## Why AI Email Writing Became an Workplace Essential

Time spent on writing emails daily? At least 30 minutes, sometimes 2-3 hours.

Chasing clients, reporting work, applying for resources, cross-department collaboration... Every email requires careful wording, afraid of making mistakes.

Using AI to help write emails: 10 minutes to finish what used to take an hour. This isn't slacking off—it's efficiency upgrading.

## 4 AI Tools for Email Writing: Real-World Comparison

### Test Scenario

Writing a payment reminder email to a client: tone should be polite but not too soft; professional but not too stiff.

### 1. ChatGPT - The Mature and Stable Type

```
Please help me write a payment reminder email to a client. Background: we've
delivered the project two months ago, and the contract stipulates payment
within 30 days after acceptance.
The tone should be friendly but professional, urging them to arrange payment.
```

**Pros**: Particularly strong in English emails, excellent tone control
**Cons**: Occasional translation feel in Chinese context
**Best for**: Foreign trade, business English emails

### 2. Claude - The Logic-Clear Type

Claude's email writing is characterized by clear structure, with clear purposes for each paragraph.

```
Please write a Chinese business email with the topic of reminding about project payment.
The email should include: 1) thanking for their cooperation; 2) explaining delivered content;
3) mentioning the contractually agreed payment date; 4) polite reminder.
```

**Pros**: Strong logic, clear structure
**Cons**: Style is somewhat conservative, lacks innovation
**Best for**: Formal reports, application emails

### 3. DownToEarth Type

DeepSeek performs very naturally in Chinese context, emails sound more like what Chinese people say.

```
Help me write a payment reminder email. We're the vendor, finished the project
two months ago, client hasn't paid yet. Tone should be friendly, can't offend,
but let them know we're urgent about getting paid.
```

**Pros**: Natural Chinese expression, not stiff
**Cons**: Needs more specific instructions
**Best for**: Chinese daily business communication

### 4. Fast Template Type (Kimi/Doubao)

These two tools are better for quickly generating email templates for manual refinement.

**Pros**: Fast response, many templates
**Cons**: Weak deep customization
**Best for**: Simple notifications, routine replies

## AI Email Writing Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Use AI-Generated Text Directly

AI-written emails are "standard answers," but your situation is "specific circumstances." Be sure to:
- Replace specific project names, dates, numbers
- Add your personal style and tone
- Check for inaccurate information

### ❌ Don't Let AI Handle Sensitive Content

AI can't help with sensitive emails involving secrets, disputes, complaints, resignations.
These emails have personal consequences—better to write them yourself.

### ❌ Don't Forget to Check Format

AI-generated emails may have format issues:
- Are recipients and CC correct?
- Are attachments actually attached?
- Is signature updated?

## Advanced Tips: Train Your AI Email Assistant

Compile your common email scenarios into a document for AI to learn your style:

```
My Email Writing Preferences:
1. I prefer "Dear" rather than "Hey"
2. Paragraphs should be 3-4 lines
3. Common expressions: [collect expressions you like]
4. Ending is usually "Looking forward to your reply"
```

Feed this to AI, and future emails will sound more like you wrote them.
