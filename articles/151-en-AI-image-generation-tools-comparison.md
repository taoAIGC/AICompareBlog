## TL;DR: No Free Lunch, Only the Right Tool for You

AI image generation has exploded in popularity over the past couple of years. From Midjourney's mind-blowing astronaut on a horse in space to Stable Diffusion's open-source revolution where everyone's making "AI waifus," the hype is real.

As someone who's been playing with this tech since DALL·E 2, I've basically tried every mainstream tool out there. In this article, I'll use real data and hands-on experience to tell you: which tool fits you best, how to choose, and how to avoid the pitfalls.

## Test Methodology

I tested 9 scenarios across 3 categories:
1. **Realistic portraits**: ID photo style, professional headshot, corporate photo
2. **Illustrations in various styles**: Flat illustration, cyberpunk, Chinese ink painting style
3. **Creative concepts**: Product renderings, architectural concepts, game concept art

Each scenario: 3 images per tool, pick the best one for scoring.

## Contestants

**Midjourney**: Started from Discord community, strongest artistic style, subscription-based but results are insane.

**DALL·E 3**: OpenAI's baby, deeply integrated with ChatGPT, unmatched text understanding, but realistic portraits look a bit "fake."

**Stable Diffusion**: Open source and free, unlimited local deployment, but requires tuning skills, highest barrier to entry.

**Leonardo AI**: Rising star, user-friendly interface, generous free tier, improving fast.

**Tongyi Wanxiang**: Chinese domestic player, excellent Chinese prompt understanding, free but quality gap exists.

## Test 1: Realistic Portrait - Professional Headshot

**Prompt**:
"Professional headshot photo, Chinese woman in her 30s, business suit, soft studio lighting, neutral background, Canon 5D quality, professional portrait, slight smile"

**Test Results**:

**Midjourney**:
Quality Score: 9/10
Pros: Amazing lighting and texture, realistic skin texture, natural color transitions
Cons: Sometimes over-processed, noticeable smoothing effect

**DALL·E 3**:
Quality Score: 7.5/10
Pros: Stable facial features, no face distortion
Cons: Overall "wax figure" feel, lacks real skin texture

**Stable Diffusion (Realistic Portrait Model)**:
Quality Score: 8.5/10
Pros: Highly customizable, can fine-tune lighting effects
Cons: Need the right model and LoRA, otherwise looks like generic "influencer face"

**Leonardo AI**:
Quality Score: 7/10
Pros: Fast generation, diverse styles
Cons: Realistic portraits aren't its strength, tends to look plastic

**Tongyi Wanxiang**:
Quality Score: 6/10
Pros: Accurate Chinese prompt understanding
Cons: Realistic portrait results are underwhelming, rough detail handling

**Summary**: Realistic portraits → Midjourney first, then Stable Diffusion. DALL·E 3 for scenarios without high realism requirements.

## Test 2: Style Illustration - Flat Commercial Illustration

**Prompt**:
"Flat vector illustration, office workers meeting, modern corporate style, minimal design, blue and white color scheme, clean lines, professional business illustration"

**Test Results**:

**Midjourney**:
Quality Score: 8.5/10
Pros: Strong artistic sense, sophisticated color pairing
Cons: Style too strong, sometimes unsuitable for commercial use

**DALL·E 3**:
Quality Score: 8/10
Pros: Accurately understands flat design requirements
Cons: Detail handling not clean enough

**Stable Diffusion**:
Quality Score: 9/10
Pros: With the right model, flat illustrations are amazing, extremely controllable
Cons: Need to train or find suitable models yourself

**Leonardo AI**:
Quality Score: 8/10
Pros: Built-in style templates, stable output
Cons: Homogenized results,容易"撞脸"

**Tongyi Wanxiang**:
Quality Score: 7/10
Pros: Chinese prompts are well-understood
Cons: Limited style library, lack of creativity

**Summary**: Commercial illustrations → Stable Diffusion (most controllable), Midjourney for artistic projects.

## Test 3: Creative Concept - Cyberpunk City

**Prompt**:
"Cyberpunk city street at night, neon lights, rainy street reflections, futuristic architecture, Blade Runner aesthetic, cinematic lighting, 8K resolution, hyperdetailed"

**Test Results**:

**Midjourney**:
Quality Score: 10/10
Pros: Cyberpunk is its specialty, atmosphere is incredible
Cons: Can be "too gorgeous," sometimes not durable enough to look at

**DALL·E 3**:
Quality Score: 8/10
Pros: Clear scene construction logic
Cons: Lacks that specific "gritty" cyberpunk atmosphere and decadent vibe

**Stable Diffusion**:
Quality Score: 9/10
Pros: Adjustable details, can achieve movie-quality texture
Cons: Requires lots of parameter tuning

**Leonardo AI**:
Quality Score: 8.5/10
Pros: Stable output, good color performance
Cons: Creativity limited by "templates"

**Tongyi Wanxiang**:
Quality Score: 6.5/10
Pros: Night scene lighting effect is acceptable
Cons: Big gap compared to foreign tools

**Summary**: Cyberpunk style → Midjourney no-brainer, results are god-tier. Stable Diffusion offers more playability.

## Speed, Price & Usability Comparison

| Tool | Speed | Free Tier | Paid Price | Learning Curve |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Midjourney | Fast | Limited | $10-60/month | Low |
| DALL·E 3 | Fast | Limited | $20/month (ChatGPT Plus) | Very Low |
| Stable Diffusion | Hardware dependent | Completely free | Hardware cost | High |
| Leonardo AI | Fast | Generous | ~$11/month | Low |
| Tongyi Wanxiang | Fast | Generous | Free | Low |

## Usage Recommendations

**Beginners**: Try DALL·E 3 or Tongyi Wanxiang first, lowest barrier, no need to stress about English prompts.

**Pursuing artistic effects**: Midjourney is the choice, though paid, the results are worth it.

**Commercial use/Batch production**: Stable Diffusion local deployment, one-time investment lifetime free, strongest controllability.

**Budget-conscious**: Leonardo AI has the most generous free tier, Tongyi Wanxiang is completely free but quality gap exists.

**Chinese prompts dominant**: Tongyi Wanxiang > DALL·E 3 > Midjourney > Leonardo AI > Stable Diffusion

## FAQ

**Q: Can AI-generated images be used commercially?**

Depends on the tool and license. Midjourney paid version is commercial-usable but controversial. Stable Diffusion open source is completely commercial没问题, but watch out for training data copyright issues. DALL·E 3's commercial terms are fuzzy.

**Q: Why do my generated images always have distorted faces?**

Common reasons: too complex prompts, wrong parameter settings, unsuitable model. Solutions: simplify prompts, add negative prompts, switch to realistic models.

**Q: Midjourney vs Stable Diffusion - which to choose?**

Want results without hassle → Midjourney
Want control without limits → Stable Diffusion
Want both → Install both, take the best of each

**Q: Can Tongyi Wanxiang compete with foreign tools?**

Chinese prompt understanding is its advantage, but image quality gap with top foreign tools exists. Wins on being free and no VPN needed.

**Q: Will AI art replace human artists?**

Short term: No. AI is great for rapid output and creative assistance, but humans are still irreplaceable for unique style expression, emotional delivery, and precise commercial illustration needs. The future trend is "human-machine collaboration."

**Q: How to write good prompts?**

Core principles: Specific + Style + Quality words
Good template: "Subject description + Style + Lighting + Quality words"
Example: "A cute cat sitting on windowsill, Pixar style, soft natural lighting, 8K, hyperdetailed"
