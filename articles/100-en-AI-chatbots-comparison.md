### Daily Q&A

All three can meet daily needs with little difference. DeepSeek responses feel more natural in Chinese context.

## Real Experience Summary

After three months of daily use, here's my honest take:

ChatGPT is the most mature with many plugins and a good ecosystem, but sometimes answers feel too "templated."

Claude is the "smartest" with strong understanding, especially long conversations don't "break," but sometimes too cautious.

DeepSeek is the cheapest with the best Chinese support, but features are relatively simple with fewer advanced capabilities.
