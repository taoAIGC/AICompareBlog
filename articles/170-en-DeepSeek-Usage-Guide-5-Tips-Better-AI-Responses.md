## What is DeepSeek?

What will be the hottest AI tools in 2025?

Not ChatGPT, not Claude, but DeepSeek.

This domestic AI has gone crazy because it is open source + free + effective.

I've been using it for a month and can tell you my true feelings.

## Why is DeepSeek so popular?

### free

ChatGPT costs money, Claude costs money, and DeepSeek is free.

For ordinary people, this alone is attractive enough.

### Open source

DeepSeek V3 is open source, and developers can use it and modify it as they please.

what does that mean?

This means you can deploy it locally without worrying about data security.

### The effect is not inferior to GPT-4

Actual measurement comparison:

Also writing a public account article, the effects of DeepSeek and GPT-4 are similar.

DeepSeek is even better in some scenarios, such as Chinese writing.

## Tip 1: Register and log in

### Official website

Just search for "DeepSeek" and the first one is the official website.

Woooooo.deep seek.com

### Registration method

Support:
- Email registration
- Mobile phone number (supports domestic mobile phones)
- Google account

It is recommended to use your email or mobile phone number to facilitate subsequent password retrieval.

### First time use

After registration is completed, you can use it directly.

The interface is very simple, similar to ChatGPT.

On the left is the historical dialogue, and on the right is the input box.

There are no complicated functions, just simple and rough conversations.

## Tip 2: How to write the prompt word

### Don’t use too long

DeepSeek is not the same as ChatGPT.

ChatGPT writes a long list of prompt words and it reads them all.

If you write DeepSeek too long, it will easily go off track.

**Correct writing**:
```
Write an article about workplace communication, about 1,000 words. The target audience is newcomers who have just joined the job. It should be practical and not too theoretical.
```

**Wrong way of writing**:
```
You are a senior human resources expert with 10 years of recruitment experience and are good at handling workplace relationship issues. Please write an article according to the following requirements: first... secondly... then... finally...
```

It’s too long, DeepSeek read the end and forgot the beginning.

### Ask step by step

Ask complex questions apart.

For example, if you want to write an article:

Step one:
```
Help me make an outline of the "Workplace Communication Skills" article, 5 parts
```

After DeepSeek gave the outline:

Step two:
```
Based on the first outline, write a 200-word detailed paragraph
```

Step three:
```
Continue writing the second outline part
```

This works much better than asking all the questions at once.

### Clear format

DeepSeek can sometimes overdo it and write a bunch of stuff you don't need.

Tell it exactly what format you want.

```
Please display it in table form. Each comparison item should include: function, DeepSeek performance, ChatGPT performance
```

```
Please explain in points, no more than 5 items, each item should not exceed 50 words.
```

It won't be free to play.

## Tip 3: Scenario-based use

### Write copy

DeepSeek is very good at writing Chinese copywriting.

Especially the down-to-earth kind.

For example, writing copy for Moments:
```
Help me write a circle of friends, saying that my colleagues gave me milk tea and cake for afternoon tea this afternoon. Be a little funny.
```

DeepSeek will give you an interesting version.

### Write code

It can also be used when writing code.

But the actual measured effect is not as good as Claude.

Claude's code writing is more standardized and his comments are clearer.

DeepSeek sometimes has minor problems when writing code, so it is recommended to check it twice.

###Write an article

DeepSeek can write official account articles, Zhihu answers, and Xiaohongshu copywriting.

Especially for content that requires "internet sense", DeepSeek's sense of language is very good.

### translate

DeepSeek's translation is more natural than Google Translate.

It's not a stiff machine translation, but it reads like human speech.

```
Please help me translate this paragraph from English to Chinese. It should be natural and not literal.
```

It works great.

### Brainstorming

Can’t think of a topic to choose? Don't know how to make a decision?

Let DeepSeek help you brainstorm.

```
I am a workplace blogger. I mainly write about workplace growth and communication skills. Please give me 10 topics to choose from.
```

It will give you a bunch of ideas.

## Tip 4: Guide to avoid pitfalls

### Don’t rely too much

DeepSeek sometimes talks serious nonsense.

It fabricates data and quotes to look professional, but is actually fake.

**Solution**:
- Manual verification of important information
- Involves multi-angle verification of professional knowledge
- Do not copy directly to the official document

### Sensitive issues

DeepSeek has content review, and there are some questions it doesn't answer.

For example:
- How to bypass payment
- How to crack software
- Sensitive historical events

It will reject these questions or give you a piece of official talk.

### Contextual restrictions

DeepSeek's context window is not as long as Claude's.

At the end of writing a long article, you may forget what was said earlier.

**Solution**:
- Write in sections, each section should be within 2,000 words.
- Repeat important information at the beginning of each paragraph
- Manually summarize the previous content and feed it to it if necessary

### Don’t ask about things that are too new.

DeepSeek's training data has an expiration date.

It may not know what happens after 2024.

Ask it "What big thing happened recently" and it will give an outdated answer.

## Tip 5: Advanced usage

### System prompt word

DeepSeek supports system prompt words.

Click Settings in the upper right corner to set the default behavior of AI.

For example:
```
You are a professional business consultant. Answer questions concisely and effectively, and use data and cases to support your opinions.
```

Once set, all subsequent conversations will take effect.

### Conversation Template

Useful prompt words can be saved as templates.

DeepSeek currently does not have an official template feature, but you can:

1. Write it in a document
2. Copy and paste when needed
3. Or take a screenshot and save it

### API calls

Developers can access via API.

DeepSeek's API is cheaper than OpenAI.

The documentation is clearly written and developer friendly.

### Local deployment

Open source means you can download the model and run it locally.

Configuration requirements:
- Graphics card with at least 16GB of video memory
- Memory 32GB or more
- Hard disk space 100GB+

Ordinary computers cannot run it, so it is recommended to use cloud services.
