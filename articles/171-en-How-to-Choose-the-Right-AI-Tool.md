## First Ask Yourself a Question

What do you want to use AI for?

This is more important than anything else.

Because different AI tools are good at different things.

Some want to write code, some want to write copy, some want to chat for fun, some want help with spreadsheets.

Choose the wrong tool, and you waste money without good results.

## First Figure Out Your Needs

### Scenario 1: Daily Chatting, Q&A, Writing

If you just want to chat casually, ask questions, or write copy.

**Recommended: DeepSeek, ChatGPT**

These two are the easiest to start with, just open the webpage and use them.

DeepSeek is even free, isn't that great?

### Scenario 2: Writing Code

If you're a programmer or want to learn programming.

**Recommended: Claude**

Claude writes the cleanest code with the clearest comments and logic.

ChatGPT is okay too, but sometimes it gets lazy.

DeepSeek has issues with code, better use Claude.

### Scenario 3: Writing Chinese Content

If you need to write public account articles, Zhihu answers, or Xiaohongshu copy.

**Recommended: DeepSeek**

DeepSeek's Chinese writing is too good, it reads like a native Chinese person wrote it.

ChatGPT's Chinese sometimes shows translation flavor, it's awkward to read.

### Scenario 4: Processing Long Documents

If you need to read a PDF of dozens of pages or analyze a long chat record.

**Recommended: Claude, Kimi**

These two are strong at long text processing.

Claude can read 100K tokens, Kimi is especially known for long texts.

### Scenario 5: Translation

If you need to translate documents or chat with foreigners.

**Recommended: DeepSeek**

DeepSeek's translation is much more natural than Google Translate.

It's not stiff machine translation, it reads like human language.

### Scenario 6: Making Tables, Processing Data

If you need to organize data, make tables, or do data analysis.

**Recommended: ChatGPT, Claude**

These two are better at handling structured data.

Writing formulas and making charts are both better than DeepSeek.

## Horizontal Comparison of Mainstream AI Tools

### Free Usage

| Tongyi Qianwen | Free with limits |
| Wenxin Yiyu | Free with limits |
| Kimi | Free with limits |

### Chinese Capability

DeepSeek > Claude > ChatGPT > Other Chinese Tools

DeepSeek has the most authentic Chinese.

### Code Capability

Claude > ChatGPT > DeepSeek

Claude writes the most standardized code.

### Response Speed

ChatGPT > Claude > DeepSeek

DeepSeek gets slow during peak hours.

### Context Length

Claude remembers the longest conversations.

## My Selection Suggestions

### Students

Use DeepSeek first, the free one is great, right?

When you need to write code, consider Claude.

### Office Workers

Use DeepSeek daily, it's enough for writing copy and translation.

Use Claude for important documents for higher quality.

### Programmers

Just use Claude directly, don't hesitate.

For writing code, Claude is currently the best.

### Self-Media People

Use DeepSeek for writing Chinese, let Claude edit it.

Use them together, the effect is better.

### Enterprise Users

Recommend using API access, controllable cost.

DeepSeek API is cheaper than OpenAI.

## What the AI Compare Plugin Can Do for You

There are so many AI tools on the market, which one is better?

Just looking at introductions isn't enough, you need to try them actually.

**AI Compare** plugin is exactly for this.

After installing, you ask one question, and Claude, GPT, and DeepSeek all answer at the same time.

No need to switch back and forth, no need to open multiple web pages.

You can see at a glance which answer is better.

I use it when I write articles.

Same question, four AI tools, four answers.

Keep the good ones, delete the bad ones directly.

Efficiency improves by more than a little.

The plugin is for Chrome, search "AI Compare" to find it.

Completely free, no registration needed.

Use it or not, I actually use it for real.

## Don't Waste Money

Many people buy ChatGPT Plus right away.

Then they find the free version is enough.

Isn't that a loss?

Use the free versions more first, figure out your needs.

Then decide whether to spend money.

AI tool competition is fierce now, all companies are fighting for users.

Free ones are often enough, paid ones aren't necessarily better.

## Final Words

AI tools have no absolute good or bad.

Only suitable or not suitable.

You write code every day? Then Claude is the best.

You write Chinese copy every day? Then DeepSeek is the best.

Don't follow the crowd, don't be blind.

Think first about what you want.

Then find the corresponding tool.

The plugin is just an auxiliary, the decision is in your own hands.

**Trying costs nothing.**
