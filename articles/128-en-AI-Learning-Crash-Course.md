## Why You're Always "Running Out of Time"

At 3 PM, your boss drops a task: "Prepare an XX industry analysis PPT for the client by tomorrow afternoon."

Your heart sinks—you've never even heard of XX industry.

Open Baidu, and the first five search results are all ads. Ask the search engine, and what comes out is either too shallow or too deep. After reading, you're still confused.

Want to ask a colleague? Too embarrassed to admit you know nothing.

So what do you do?

Either rush through a Baidu Encyclopedia-level PPT and get questioned by the client for "not professional enough"; or stay up until 2 AM, finally finishing something barely presentable, while thinking: "If only someone could help me organize this..."

I've been there more times than I can count.

## My Method: Let AI Be Your "Crash Course Master"

Later I discovered a trick: instead of fishing in the ocean alone, let AI "teach" you from multiple angles at once.

**The core idea is simple—**

Ask the same question to 4 AIs. ChatGPT gives you a framework, Claude adds details, DeepSeek might point out logical holes, and Kimi excels at summarizing long texts into a few key points.

Four people working for you at once—isn't that better than pulling an all-nighter alone?

### Why Isn't One AI Enough?

Because each AI has different "blind spots."

ChatGPT's answers are often well-rounded but may lack practicality. Claude writes well but can be too "academic." DeepSeek knows more about local Chinese contexts but occasionally sounds outdated. Kimi is great for processing long documents but falls short on creativity.

Looking at any single one feels like "something's missing," but together? They complement each other perfectly.

## Live Demo: 3 Hours to Master "Carbon Neutrality"

Let me give you a real example.

Last month, a friend suddenly asked me: "Can you help me create a carbon neutrality beginner guide? The client needs it."

My reaction: Carbon neutrality? I can only spout the buzzwords—I don't know the details.

Before, I would have spent three days researching online. But now?

### Step 1: Ask 4 AIs Simultaneously

I typed into the plugin:

"Please explain what carbon neutrality is in plain language. What are its core goals? What can ordinary people do?"

Then—4 AIs gave me their answers simultaneously.

**ChatGPT's version**: Clear structure, divided into definition, goals, and actions—like a textbook.

**Claude's version**: More relatable, added many life-oriented metaphors, not boring to read.

**DeepSeek's version**: Mentioned many local Chinese policies and data, more practical for domestic contexts.

**Kimi's version**: Directly listed 10 specific actions ordinary people can take, with priority markers.

### Step 2: Cross-Validate and Combine

I didn't directly use any single version. Instead, I "patched together" a comprehensive solution—

Used ChatGPT's framework for structure, Claude's phrasing for polish, DeepSeek's data to add Chinese context, and Kimi's action list as the implementation section.

Total time: less than 2 hours. A "Carbon Neutrality Beginner Guide" was complete. My friend said: "This is much clearer than the materials I found online."

### Step 3: Check for Gaps

After finishing, I asked AI a few more questions:
- "What are common misconceptions ordinary people have?"
- "Are there any counter-intuitive points that need special attention?"

Added these questions and answers. A "not-so-amateur" beginner guide was complete.

From complete ignorance to being able to chat with clients for 10 minutes without slipping up—3 hours total.

## Which Scenarios Suit "AI Crash Course" Best?

Not everything is suitable for AI cramming. But in these scenarios, it can truly save your life:

### Scenario 1: Suddenly Assigned to Present an "Unknown" Field

Your boss asks you to talk about "metaverse applications in retail"—and you only know Zuckerberg renamed Meta.

Let AI help you outline, add cases, find data. 1 hour of prep is enough to speak confidently for 10 minutes.

### Scenario 2: Client Asks a Professional Term You Don't Understand

During a meeting, the client suddenly says: "Can your solution do a SWOT analysis?"—and you only know how to pronounce these four letters.

Let AI explain what SWOT is, how to do it, what to watch out for. In 3 minutes, you can keep up with the conversation.

### Scenario 3: Need to Quickly Understand an Industry's Upstream and Downstream

Landed a new project where the client is in new energy, but you haven't even mapped out the industry chain.

Let AI help you draw an industry map—from raw materials to end applications, who are the main players in each link. In half an hour, you won't feel so intimidated in front of the client.

### Scenario 4: Intensive Cramming Before Exams/Certifications/Interviews

Have a PMP exam next week, the book is too thick to finish. Let AI list high-frequency topics, create practice questions, explain complex concepts.

At least 3x more efficient than rote memorization.

## Pro Tip: Let AI "Simulate Exams" for You

Simply asking questions isn't enough. You can have AI play the "examiner"—

"Based on the previous content, create 5 multiple-choice questions to test me."

"If I were the client, what questions would I ask to challenge my proposal?"

This "test yourself" method helps quickly identify knowledge gaps.

Sometimes I ask AI: "What are the 10 most common questions beginners have about carbon neutrality?" Then memorize those questions and answers—almost exactly what clients ask in meetings.

## Tool Recommendation: Fewer Mouse Clicks

I know what you're thinking—opening 4 websites and logging into 4 accounts every time is too troublesome.

That's why I've been using a browser plugin that solves this problem.

No need to remember URLs, no repeated logins needed. Open Chrome, click the icon, type one question, 4 AIs answer simultaneously.

ChatGPT on the left, Claude on the right, DeepSeek and Kimi in the middle. One screen comparison, everything at a glance.

The time you save—wouldn't you rather spend it drinking coffee?
