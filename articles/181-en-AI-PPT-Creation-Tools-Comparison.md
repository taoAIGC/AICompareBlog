## As Someone Who Frequently Makes PPTs

Honestly, I'm more afraid of making PowerPoints than writing code.

Every time I need to present work or demonstrate a product, finding templates, adjusting formats, and choosing color schemes can easily take half a day.

Especially when the deadline is at night - you know what I'm talking about.

Until I discovered that AI-powered PPT creation is actually quite good now. Today I'll review all the major AI PPT tools I've used to help you save time.

## What AI PPT Tools Can Do Now

Let me explain the current capabilities of these tools:

**What they can do**:
- Generate outlines and content automatically from a topic
- One-click template and color scheme matching
- Auto-generate charts and data visualization
- Support multi-language translation

**What they can't do**:
- Fully understand your business details
- Generate directly usable professional-level PPTs
- Replace your presentation logic and thinking

Overall: **They can save you 70% of the work, but the remaining 30% is still up to you.**

## Major AI PPT Tools Comparison

**Meitu AI PPT** is suitable for visually-oriented content with younger-themed templates.

**Who it's for**: Budget-conscious people making domestic scenario PPTs.

## Which One Should You Choose

My suggestion:

**If you're in a hurry** → Gamma is fastest, results in seconds

**If you need professionalism** → Beautiful.ai has the best design

**If you use Google Slides** → SlidesAI is most convenient

**If you're doing creative displays** → Tome is most suitable

**If you're making Chinese PPTs** → iFlytek ZhiWen understands you better

## Practical Tips

1. **Write your outline first**
   
   AI-generated content is a foundation. Organizing your thoughts clearly before feeding it to AI works 10x better.

2. **Choose the right template before generating**
   
   Many tools let you select an industry first - choosing the right industry makes content more accurate.

3. **Manual review is essential**
   
   AI sometimes makes errors in data or logic, especially for professional content - always review it yourself.

4. **Fine-tune with native software after export**
   
   Exporting to PPT and adjusting animations and layout in PowerPoint or Keynote greatly improves results.

## How I Use Them Myself

My current PPT workflow:

1. Use Gamma to quickly generate a first draft
2. Use Beautiful.ai for inspiration on layouts
3. Fine-tune in PowerPoint
4. Use Tome for presentation mode

Previously, making a presentation took half a day; now I can finish a quality deck in 2 hours.

Of course, for core data and professional content, I still write it myself and use AI for assistance.

## Final Thoughts

AI PPT tools, like when Office replaced handwriting, are an inevitable trend.

They won't make you a presentation master, but they can free you from tedious formatting work and let you focus more on the content itself.

**Tools are meant to be used, not to cause anxiety.**

Good luck with your future presentations.
