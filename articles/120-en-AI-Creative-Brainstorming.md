## Using AI Tools in Creative Work

Creative block is a common problem for creators, designers, and marketers. The good news is that AI tools can become your creative partner, helping you break through mental barriers and generate endless inspiration. This article introduces how to use multi-AI collaboration for brainstorming to make creative work easier.

## Why Use AI for Brainstorming

Traditional brainstorming relies on one person or a few people, easily falling into fixed thinking patterns. The advantages of AI brainstorming include:

- **No emotional influence**: AI is always ready, never tired, never in a bad mood
- **Diverse perspectives**: Different AIs have different "thinking styles" and can provide ideas from different angles
- **Rapid iteration**: Generate dozens of ideas in seconds for quick screening and optimization
- **Cross-domain association**: AI can connect completely unrelated fields to produce unexpected creative ideas

## Recommended AI Combinations

For different creative scenarios, here are the recommended AI tool combinations:

| Task Type | Recommended AI | Main Features |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Concept generation | Doubao | Creative, many ideas, suitable for wild thinking |
| Logic organization | Claude | Clear structure, helps organize thoughts |
| Detail refinement | ChatGPT | Balanced and comprehensive, accurate expression |
| Chinese creativity | Kimi | Good Chinese context understanding, down-to-earth |
| Visual creativity | Midjourney | Image generation, visualizes ideas |

## How to Use AI for Brainstorming

### Step 1: Clarify Your Question

Before starting, write down the problem you want to solve. For example:
- "Help me design a slogan for a coffee shop"
- "Create a marketing plan for Gen Z"
- "Think of 10 short video topics"

The more specific your question, the more useful the AI's answers will be.

### Step 2: Ask Multiple AIs at Once

Open the AI Compare plugin and send the same question to 3-4 AIs simultaneously. You'll find each AI has a completely different answer style.

### Step 3: Screen and Combine

Write down the ideas you like, then let AI:
- Combine several ideas
- Optimize a certain idea
- Develop a certain direction further

### Step 4: Manual Screening

AI-generated ideas aren't necessarily all good. Pick 3-5 you like best, then add your professional judgment to optimize them.

## Practical Creative Templates

### Template 1: Give AI a Role

"You are a brand planner with 10 years of experience, help me think..."

Having AI play a professional role can give you more professional advice.

### Template 2: Give AI Some Constraints

"Help me write 10 slogans, requirements: no more than 8 characters, rhyming, reflecting youthful vitality."

Appropriate constraints can actually inspire better creativity.

### Template 3: Let AIs Evaluate Each Other

"Help me evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these creative ideas from a professional perspective"

Let AI be your critic to help perfect ideas.

## Common Application Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Copywriting

When writing ad copy, social media content, or product descriptions, let AI provide multiple versions for selection.

### Scenario 2: Product Naming

Company naming, product naming, project code names - let AI provide multiple style options.

### Scenario 3: Event Planning

Annual party planning, birthday party, marketing activities - let AI help you think of activities and processes.

### Scenario 4: Content Topic Selection

Confused about self-media content topics? Let AI think of 10 topic directions for you.

### Scenario 5: Problem Solving

Encountered a tricky problem at work? Let AI help you analyze it from different angles.
