## TL;DR: No Perfect Translation, Only Best Fit for Each Scenario

As someone who deals with English and Japanese regularly, I've basically tried every translation tool on the market.

Here's the truth: no tool can completely dominate all others. DeepL is great for English but sometimes stumbles on Japanese. Google Translate handles everything but accuracy is hit or miss. ChatGPT is the smartest but you need to know how to prompt it properly.

In this article, I'll use real test data to show you the pros and cons of each tool and how to choose.

## Test Methodology

I tested 4 different types of texts:
1. Business email (Chinese to English)
2. Product manual (English to Chinese)
3. Academic paper abstract (Chinese to English)
4. Daily conversation (Japanese to Chinese)

I translated each text with all 5 tools and compared scores.
