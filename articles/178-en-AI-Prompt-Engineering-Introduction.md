## Have You Had This Experience?

"Help me write an article."

"Help me make a plan."

"Help me analyze this data."

And the AI's response makes you want to say: **Is that it?**

Don't rush to blame the AI.

Sometimes it's not that the AI can't do it, it's that you didn't ask clearly.

The same piece of pork, a beginner makes it tough and chewy, a master chef makes it melt in your mouth. The key isn't the pork, it's the cooking skills.

**Writing prompts is the same thing.**

## What is Prompt Engineering?

It sounds fancy, but to put it simply: **how to communicate clearly with AI.**

AI is like a super intern. Highly educated, wide knowledge base, but needs you to explain tasks clearly.

If you say "help me write something," it doesn't know what to write, how to write it, or for whom.

But if you say "help me write an 800-word WeChat article about AI writing tips, target audience is new self-media creators, include some specific examples, keep the tone casual," what it gives you is completely different.

This is the core of prompt engineering: **be clear, specific, and complete about your needs.**

## Five Tips to Double Your AI Response Quality

### Tip 1: Provide Clear Context

AI isn't a mind reader; it doesn't know your specific situation.

**❌ Wrong:**
"Help me write a product description."

**✅ Right:**
"Our product is a budgeting app for college students with 500K monthly active users. We want a product description for the homepage that highlights 'simplicity' and 'security' as selling points, within 100 words."

The more background info you give AI, the closer its response will be to your needs.

### Tip 2: Specify Output Format

Without specifying format, AI will just write whatever.

**❌ Wrong:**
"Analyze the pros and cons of this product."

**✅ Right:**
"Use table format to analyze pros and cons, with three columns: Pros (with specifics), Cons (with specifics), Improvement Suggestions."

Sometimes adding "output in Markdown format" or "split into clear sections" makes AI's output much neater.

### Tip 3: Give a Reference

Don't know what style you want? Give an example.

**❌ Wrong:**
"Help me write an opening statement."

**✅ Right:**
"Reference the style of the Dedao app and write an opening statement for a knowledge-paid course. It should have that feeling of 'I should have known this earlier,' around 200 words."

Or just give a piece of writing you like and tell AI "write in this style."

### Tip 4: Ask in Steps

Complex tasks all at once, AI tends to miss things.

**❌ Wrong:**
"Help me write a 2000-word article with intro, three cases, conclusion, plus some punchlines, and end with a call to action."

**✅ Right:**
Step 1: "Help me outline an article about AI writing tips. Should have an engaging intro, three progressive cases, a powerful conclusion."

Step 2: "Based on this outline, first write the intro part, around 300 words."

Step 3: "Write the first case about how ChatGPT helps self-media people improve efficiency."

...

Take it step by step; AI gives better feedback at each stage.

### Tip 5: Tell AI What NOT to Do

Sometimes telling AI what to avoid is more effective than what to do.

**❌ Wrong:**
"Help me write an ad copy."

**✅ Right:**
"Write an ad copy for selling coffee. Requirements: 1. Not too literary, keep it down-to-earth 2. Avoid words like 'aromatic' and 'silky' 3. Should be visual 4. Ending should create purchase urge."

Negative lists are sometimes more useful than positive ones.

## Advanced Technique: Role-Playing

Having AI play a specific role makes its performance much better.

**Normal Mode:**
"How do I write a good article?"

**Role Mode:**
"You are a senior editor with 10 years of experience, who has worked at Sanlian Life Weekly. From an editor's perspective, tell me what kind of articles can move readers, and what's the difference between good and bad articles."

The latter gives more professional and deeper answers because AI taps into the knowledge base of the "editor" role.

Common effective roles:
- Senior editor/journalist
- Industry expert
- Bestselling author
- Product manager
- Programmer
- Psychological counselor
- Marketing expert

Choose the right role, and AI's answer quality jumps a level.

## Practical Case: Writing a WeChat Moment Post

I have a friend who sells oranges from their own orchard on WeChat Moments. Their previous caption was:

"Fresh oranges are here! High sweetness, plenty of juice, DM me if you need some."

I helped optimize it using the techniques above:

"You're an agricultural e-commerce copywriter expert. Help me write a WeChat Moments post for selling oranges. Requirements: 1. Highlight freshness and sweetness 2. Create urgency with 'limited' and 'seasonal' vibes 3. Be authentic, not too salesy 4. Ending should guide people to DM for prices."

Here's what AI came up with:

"Went up the mountain today, the oranges are almost ready. 🍊

This year has plenty of rain, sweetness is better than last year. The boss (my dad) says they're ready to pick.

Mountain fruit is like this - after the season, it's gone. Those who want some, hurry up.

DM me, I'll send you the address, shipped fresh from the tree."

This post got 3 times more inquiries than before.

## Tool Recommendation: AI Compare

There's a pain point with writing prompts: you don't know how different AIs answer the same question.

For the same question, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Doubao's answers can be completely different.

Use the **AI Compare** plugin to input once and see multiple AI answers simultaneously. Compare and learn how to write prompts more effectively.

The plugin works on both Chrome and Edge browsers, completely free.

## To Sum Up

Prompt engineering isn't hard; remember these points:

1. **Be clear about context** - AI isn't a mind reader
2. **Specify format** - Without it, AI will just do whatever
3. **Give references** - Examples work better than abstract requirements
4. **Break down complex tasks** - Doing everything at once leads to mistakes
5. **Negative lists are sometimes better** - Tell AI what not to do

In the AI era, people who know how to ask questions have an advantage over those who just answer them.

And knowing how to ask questions is essentially **knowing how to think.**
