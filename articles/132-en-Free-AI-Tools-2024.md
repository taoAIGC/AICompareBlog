## Saving Money is a Real Need

ChatGPT costs money. Claude costs money. DeepSeek doesn't.

I'm not kidding—there are plenty of free AI tools available in China, but most people don't even know. After all that VPN trouble, you find out domestic options work just fine.

Let me be clear: in 2024, which AI tools can you use for free without a VPN?

## Free AI Tools Overview

### 1. DeepSeek: The Rising Star

The domestic model that's been blowing up lately. Completely free.

## How to Use All 4 at Once?

Opening 4 websites every time is annoying?

Install a plugin to save effort. Open all AIs with one click. No need to remember URLs or log in repeatedly. Enter your question once, get answers from all 4 AIs.

## Which to Choose for Different Scenarios?

| Scenario | Recommended Tool | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Writing/debugging code | DeepSeek | Strong logic, high-quality code |
| Reading papers/long docs | Kimi | 2M token context |
| Quick daily Q&A | Doubao | Fast response, no lag |
| English writing/translation | ChatGPT 3.5 | Better English ecosystem |
| Chinese copywriting | Kimi + DeepSeek | Natural Chinese expressions |

## Real User Experience

I've been rotating through these 4 tools. Here's what I think:

**DeepSeek** has been really hot lately, and its code capabilities are solid. But it can get slow during peak hours—recommend avoiding 8-10 PM.

**Kimi** is amazing for reading papers. Throw in a dozen papers and ask questions together—way faster than reading one by one. Only downside is the free version has limits.

**Doubao** is just a worry-free choice. Fast response, no hassle. Enough for weekly reports and minor copywriting.

**ChatGPT 3.5** might be old, but it's still the go-to for English scenarios. Especially for looking up technical documentation—it gives Stack Overflow-style answers.

## FAQ

### Q: Is the free version enough?

For most scenarios, yes. If you're just writing copy, asking questions, or reading papers, the free version is more than sufficient.

### Q: Do I need to bind my phone number?

Some tools require it, but the process is quick. Compared to VPN trouble, this is nothing.

### Q: Which one is most like ChatGPT?

Doubao has the most similar interaction style. DeepSeek has the closest answer quality. Kimi focuses on long-text processing.

### Q: Can business users use these?

Personal use is completely fine. For commercial use, check each provider's enterprise terms.

## Summary

Free AI tools aren't unavailable—you just haven't found the right ones.

DeepSeek, Kimi, Doubao, ChatGPT 3.5—these 4 will last you a long time.

Don't waste money. Master these free tools first.
