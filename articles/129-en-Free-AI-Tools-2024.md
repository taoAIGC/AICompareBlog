## Why We're All Hunting for "Free" AI

Honestly, I've got several AI apps on my phone, but I haven't spent a dime on any of them.

It's not about being cheap—it's about principle. Why should I pay when there are perfectly good free options?

And let's be real: the AI space moves so fast these days. Today ChatGPT Plus is king, tomorrow Claude catches up, the next day DeepSeek drops and blows everyone away. You just paid $199 for Plus, and now there's a free model that's just as good.

So my strategy is simple: **if there's a free option, I'm taking it.**

Today I'm sharing my top 4 free AI tools—the ones I've actually used for over six months. The best part? **No VPN needed, works right in your browser.**

## 1. Kimi: The Long-Context King

**Free Tier**: Free monthly quota is actually enough
**Best For**: Long document analysis, file reading, multi-turn conversations
**Why Recommend**: One of the most generous Chinese AI platforms

Kimi comes from Moonshot AI (backed by ByteDance). I didn't really pay attention to it at first—but then I realized: **this thing handles long documents like a beast.**

Last time I threw a 30,000-word industry report at it and asked for key takeaways. It took 30 seconds and gave me 20 solid insights without missing a single important data point.

Compare that to ChatGPT, which starts slacking after a few thousand words, or Claude, which is better but still limited. Kimi really plays in a different league.

### Who Should Use It?

- Students and researchers who need to read reports and papers
- Professionals processing lots of documents
- People who like asking lots of questions in one go

### When to Switch?

Kimi's weakness is creative writing. For marketing copy or taglines, it tends to sound too formal—missing that creative spark.

**Where to Get It**: Kimi website / WeChat mini-program

## 2. DeepSeek: The Coder's Best Friend

**Free Tier**: Completely free right now
**Best For**: Code debugging, logical reasoning, Chinese language understanding
**Why Recommend**: The dark horse of Chinese AI models

DeepSeek has been blowing up lately. I was skeptical at first—"how good can a Chinese AI really be?"

Well, I got served.

I was working on some Python code with a nested loop performance issue. Tried everything, couldn't fix it. Asked ChatGPT—solution didn't work. Asked Claude—right idea but syntax errors.

Gave DeepSeek a shot, expecting nothing.

**Not only did it give me working code, it explained WHY my approach was slow and HOW its solution was faster.**

I was genuinely impressed.

### Who Should Use It?

- Programmers and students (coding, homework help)
- Anyone needing strong analytical reasoning
- Work requiring deep Chinese language understanding

### When to Switch?

DeepSeek's downside is that it can sound a bit... plain. Not a knock—it just doesn't have that "polished" feel of ChatGPT. If you need sophisticated, elegant writing, look elsewhere.

**Where to Get It**: DeepSeek website / App stores

## 3. Doubao: The ByteDance All-Rounder

**Free Tier**: 100% free
**Best For**: Everyday Q&A, text generation, multimodal
**Why Recommend**: ByteDance knows products—they make good ones

Doubao is ByteDance's AI assistant. And ByteDance? They make solid products with great user experience.

I use Doubao most for **text assistance**. Like when I need to write a WeChat post but I've been staring at the screen for hours with nothing—throw it to Doubao, 3 seconds later I get 5 versions.

One time I needed to post a product promo on WeChat, used Doubao's version directly. Got 30% more views than my own attempts.

### Who Should Use It?

- Marketing and social media folks
- Sales teams needing quick copy
- Anyone who wants "one-click generation"

### When to Switch?

Doubao's weakness is long conversations. If you need to discuss complex topics in depth, it tends to lose the thread. Also, some specialized topics are still surface-level.

**Where to Get It**: Search "Doubao" on Douyin / Official website

## 4. Wenxin Yiyan (ERNIE): The Baidu Veteran

**Free Tier**: Free version is more than enough
**Best For**: Chinese understanding, knowledge Q&A, search-enhanced answers
**Why Recommend**: Baidu's search expertise shows

Wenxin Yiyan is Baidu's AI. You know Baidu—the Chinese Google.

I'll be honest: I was skeptical. "Baidu can make good AI?"

After using it, I realized **the search background actually makes a difference.**

For example, when I ask factual questions, its citations are more accurate than other AIs. It shows sources, unlike some AIs that just make things up.

### Who Should Use It?

- Anyone needing accurate, factual answers
- People who value "cited sources"
- Work requiring verified information

### When to Switch?

Wenxin's weakness is creativity. If you want it to write stories or poetry, performance is average—specialized creative AIs do better.

**Where to Get It**: Baidu search "Wenxin Yiyan" / App

## My "Free" Workflow

So you're wondering—isn't it exhausting to use all four?

Honestly? A little.

That's why I use a browser extension. No need to open multiple sites—type your question once, all four AIs answer simultaneously.

Kimi on the left, DeepSeek on the right, Doubao and Wenxin in the middle. Use whichever answer is best, compare and improve.

The time you save—wouldn't you rather spend it scrolling TikTok?

**Where to Get It**:
- Chrome Web Store search «AI比一比»
- Or visit: [Chrome Store Link]
- Shortcut: Ctrl+M (Win) / Cmd+M (Mac)

## Conclusion: Being Cheap Isn't Bad

Many think "free users are just broke."

I disagree. **Smart people use free stuff.**

The AI industry is crazy right now—new models drop monthly. You pay $199 today, tomorrow you're kicking yourself.

These four free AIs? They're not lacking:

- Kimi: Long document processing king
- DeepSeek: Logic and coding beast
- Doubao: Quick copy generator
- Wenxin: Reliable knowledge base

That's enough. Really.

All that money you're saving—wouldn't you rather spend it on a nice dinner?
