## Introduction

Every time I write a weekly report, I feel like I'm writing a "流水账" (nonsense diary entry).

"This week I finished XX work, next week I plan XX items" — I feel awkward even reading it myself. What's more awkward is having to rack my brains to hit 300 words, afraid my boss thinks I'm doing nothing.

Later I discovered I'm not the only one. The whole friend circle is complaining about weekly reports:
- "Weekly reports are as long as love letters"
- "Monday morning starts with worrying about weekly reports"
- "A whole week's work, yet I can't even compose 200 words"

Until I started using AI weekly report generators.

After testing 5 mainstream tools, I decided to write this review. This isn't an advertisement, just sharing.

## My Recommendations

### If you only want to use one tool

**Choose Claude**.

It generates weekly reports most like a real person would write, without that strong AI taste. And it's very convenient to modify — whatever you ask it to change, it changes.

### If you pursue efficiency

**Throw the raw information in and let AI help you polish**.

My approach: Jot down what I did each day on sticky notes, spend 3 minutes dumping those scattered items to AI on Friday, and generate the weekly report with one click.

实测 (tested): Claude can generate a report in 5 seconds, no modifications needed.

**Final advice**: AI is just a tool, don't let it think for you. Your work achievements are the core content of weekly reports — AI just helps you express them better.
