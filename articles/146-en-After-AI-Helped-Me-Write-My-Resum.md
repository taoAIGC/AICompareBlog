# After AI Helped Me Write My Resume, Interview Opportunities Doubled

---

## 1

My cousin Xiao Zhang was job hunting last year. He sent out over 30 resumes and heard nothing back.

He came to me: "Bro, can you check if my resume has problems?"

I opened it up. Wow.
"Responsible for company-related work" — Which company? What work?
"Strong communication skills" — How strong? Any examples?
"Familiar with office software" — Word or Excel? What level?

I said: "Are you writing a resume or a riddle? HR will be confused."

He said: "I really don't know how to write. I didn't do much in college."

I said: "No worries, let AI help you."

Most people write resumes in two extreme ways:

Either they think they have nothing to write, so they just list a few bullet points like a流水账.
Or they write too much and too dense, HR wants to close it after 3 seconds.

Actually, **a good resume = experience + achievements + numbers**.

No experience? College assignments, club activities, part-time jobs all count.
No achievements? "Responsible for X" is weaker than "Completed X, improved X by X%".
No numbers? "Improved 30%" is more powerful than "good results".

How to write? AI can help.

### How to Have AI Write Your Resume

**Step 1: Dump all your experiences**

Don't worry about format. Just write down everything you've done:

"I worked in the student union publicity department, responsible for designing posters and writing official account posts."
"I worked at an electronics factory during summer, on the assembly line."
"I tutored neighborhood kids in math."
"I ran a Taobao shop, sold gaming equipment."

**Step 2: Let AI rewrite it in resume language:**

```
You are an HR professional with 10 years of experience. Help me optimize my resume.
I am a fresh graduate. Here are my experiences:
[Paste your experiences]

Please rewrite in resume format, requirements:
1. Each item should include "what I did" + "results"
2. Start with action verbs
3. Highlight quantifiable achievements
4. Keep it to one page
```

**Step 3: Fine-tune for different positions**

Applying for tech roles? Highlight coding, projects, problem-solving.
Applying for operations roles? Highlight planning, data analysis, user communication.
Applying for sales roles? Highlight communication skills, sales achievements, people skills.

One template for all positions is worse than targeted modifications.

### How to Use AI for Interview Preparation

Resume is written. The interview is the real test.

Many people don't know what to prepare for interviews. Either they wait anxiously or memorize a bunch of useless stuff.

Actually, **interview prep = common questions + your stories + practice**.

**AI helps list common questions:**

```
You are an experienced interviewer. Help me predict interview questions for this position:
Position: New Media Operations
Requirements: Responsible for official account and Weibo content planning, follower growth

List 10 most likely questions and provide answer directions.
```

Get the questions and prepare them one by one. Fit your stories into them.

**How to tell your story:**

Learn the STAR method:
- **S**ituation: What was the situation?
- **T**ask: What was your goal?
- **A**ction: What did you actually do?
- **R**esult: What was the outcome?

For example, when asked "Do you think you have good communication skills":

"(S) In college, I noticed club event signups were very low. (T) I wanted to increase it to 100. (A) I did three things: 1) Designed more attractive posters; 2) Contacted club leaders one by one; 3) Posted in campus groups. (R) Finally got 156 signups, 60% more than before."

With situation, action, and result, it's more powerful than just saying "I have strong communication skills."

### What to Do If You're Nervous Before Interviews

Xiao Zhang couldn't sleep before interviews from nervousness.

I said: "What are you nervous about? Worst case is you don't get it."

He said: "I'm just scared."

I said: "Let me teach you a method. Before the interview, turn AI into an interviewer and practice three times."

**Mock interview prompt:**

```
You are an interviewer for the position [job title].
Ask me 5 common interview questions. Ask one at a time, wait for my answer, then evaluate, then ask the next.
You can be strict and point out problems with my answers.
```

Practice with AI once and you'll have more confidence. In the real interview, you'll find "I've practiced these questions," cutting nervousness by half.

### How to Negotiate Salary with AI's Help

Salary is the hardest part to bring up in interviews.

Too low cheats yourself. Too high and they might reject you.

**Let AI do salary research:**

```
I'm interviewing for a [position] in [city]. What's the average salary for this role?
Please give salary ranges for different experience levels.
```

Once you know the numbers, you have a basis for negotiation.

**Let AI help with salary negotiation dialogue:**

```
The company offered me 8000/month, but I want 10000.
Please simulate a salary negotiation dialogue, teach me how to bring it up and how to convince them.
```

Practice ahead of time. When the moment comes, you won't be at a loss for words.

### How to Follow Up After Interviews

Many people just wait idly after interviews.

Actually, **interview follow-up = thank you message + review**.

**How to write thank you message:**

```
I interviewed today at [company] for the [position]. The interviewer was [name].
Please write a thank you message under 100 words, expressing my enthusiasm for the position and期待回复.
```

**How to review:**

After each interview, take 10 minutes to note:
- Which questions did I answer well?
- Which questions did I answer poorly?
- How can I improve next time?

Xiao Zhang practiced this method for a month. Each subsequent interview went smoother than the last.

### A Few Final Points

**First, resume is a敲门砖, not your whole story.**

Good writing doesn't mean you're capable, but bad writing might cost you interview opportunities. Spending time polishing is worth it.

**Second, AI is an assistant, not a replacement.**

AI helps organize, optimize, and practice. But you're the one who actually performs. Memorize what needs memorizing, practice what needs practicing.

**Third, it's normal to not get every interview. Don't be discouraged.**

Job hunting is a numbers game. Getting 1 offer out of 10 applications is a win. Every interview is a learning opportunity. More reviews lead to higher success rates.
