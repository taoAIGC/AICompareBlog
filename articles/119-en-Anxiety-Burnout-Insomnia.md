## Have You Ever Had Moments Like These?

At 2 AM, lying in bed, unable to sleep.

Your mind is full of the boss's criticism from that day, colleagues' expressions, unfinished tasks...

Your body is exhausted, but your brain won't stop.

**You're not alone.**

According to data, over 60% of employees say they often feel anxious. And a large portion of them are experiencing something called "mental burnout."

## What Is Mental Burnout?

Simply put, it's **your inner self "fighting itself."**

- One look from your boss, and you wonder: "Is he mad at me?"
- A colleague doesn't reply to your message, and you焦虑: "Did I offend them?"
- Making a decision, with two voices in your head constantly arguing: "Choose A or B... no, I can't sleep"

This internal tug-of-war is the most draining.

## 4 Signs of Workplace Anxiety

### Sign 1: Pre-sleep "Review Competition"

Lying down, you start replaying every word and expression from that day.

"God, did I say something wrong in the meeting?"

"Ugh, my boss's expression—was he mad at me?"

The more you think, the more awake you get, and the more awake you are, the more you think.

### Sign 2: Over-preparation

- Writing an email, checking it 10 times for fear of wrong wording
- Making a PPT, revising it 20 times for fear of criticism
- Sending a message, deleting and rewriting multiple times, afraid of making a mistake

Simple things become difficult to get past in your mind.

### Sign 3: Body Alarms

- Frequent headaches, stomach aches
- Easy fatigue, unexplained tiredness
- Heart palpitations, chest tightness, shortness of breath
- Insomnia or poor sleep quality

### Sign 4: Being Especially Hard on Yourself

- Blaming yourself for the smallest mistakes
- Starting to doubt yourself when you see colleagues getting promoted
- Feeling like you're not good enough anywhere

## Why Are Employees Prone to Anxiety?

### Reason 1: Too Much Uncertainty

- Will the project get cancelled?
- Will the boss be satisfied?
- How much will the year-end bonus be?
- Will I be laid off next round?

Work is full of things we can't control, and anxiety is a natural response to uncertainty.

### Reason 2: Social Comparison

"My college classmate is already making a million"

"My colleague just got promoted"

"That guy from another team who joined a year after me is already a team lead"

Comparison has no end, and neither does anxiety.

### Reason 3: Perfectionism

- Feeling like you need to score 100 on everything
- Not accepting any mistakes
- Being harsher on yourself than your boss is

Perfectionism is the breeding ground for anxiety.

### Reason 4: Blurred Work-Life Boundaries

- WeChat/WhatsApp available 24/7
- Having to reply to messages on weekends
- Still thinking about work after leaving the office

Without breathing room, anxiety builds up.

## How to Break Free from Workplace Anxiety?

### Method 1: Distinguish "Facts" from "Thoughts"

When anxious, most thoughts in your head are "assumptions," not facts.

Your boss not smiling today ≠ your boss is mad at you

A colleague not replying ≠ they hate you

Project delay ≠ I'll be fired

**Ask yourself one question: "Is this a fact, or just my guess?"**

### Method 2: Set "Anxiety Time"

Sounds weird, but it really works.

Give yourself 15 minutes every day, specifically for worrying.

In those 15 minutes, you can worry all you want, write it down, think it through.

At other times, tell yourself: "These issues, I'll think about them during anxiety time."

It's been tested—many people end up spending less time worrying.

### Method 3: Lower Standards, Accept "Good Enough"

Perfectionism is a major source of anxiety.

Try changing "I need to score 100" to "60 is passing, 80 is great."

You'll find that many things aren't actually that important.

### Method 4: Establish Work Boundaries

- Don't reply to work messages after work hours (unless truly urgent)
- At least one day on weekends without work
- Leave yourself some "pure rest" time

Your brain needs rest, not a 24/7 machine.

### Method 5: Get Moving

Exercise is nature's anti-anxiety medication.

No need for intense workouts—walking, running, yoga all work.

The key is: **get your body moving, give your brain a break.**

### Method 6: Talk to Someone

Anxiety loves hiding in your head, and the more you think, the worse it gets.

Talk to a friend, colleague, or professional therapist.

Speaking it out is a release in itself.

## When Do You Need Professional Help?

In these situations, consider seeing a psychologist or therapist:

- Anxiety is already affecting normal work and life
- Experiencing panic attacks (sudden rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, extreme fear)
- Persistent insomnia for over two weeks
- Frequently feeling hopeless or having thoughts of self-harm

**Seeing a therapist is nothing to be ashamed of—just like seeing a doctor for a cold is normal.**

## A Message to You, Currently Anxious

I know you might be going through a tough time right now.

But please remember:

**Anxiety is not your fault.**

It's just an emotion, like happiness or sadness.

You don't need to "defeat" it—you just need to learn to coexist with it.

Today, try doing just one thing first:

**Put down your phone, sleep early once.**
