## Why AI Copywriting Became an Essential Skill for Workers

Honestly, copywriting used to be my biggest headache.

Whether it was writing a work report for the boss or a product introduction for a friend, I could stare at a blank document for half an hour every time. Then I started using AI to help, and hey, gotta say—it's pretty great.

Today, let's skip the fluff and talk about how to use AI to genuinely improve copywriting efficiency.

## Tip #1: Give AI a Clear "Persona"

When people first start using AI for copywriting, they often just say "Help me write a product introduction." The AI's response is either too formal or too vague to use.

The right approach: First tell AI who it is.

For example, if you're writing promotional copy for a fitness app, try this:

"You are a marketing copywriter with 5 years of experience, especially good at writing youthful product promotion copy. Now I need you to write an introduction for a fitness app targeting office workers, keep it under 150 words, and use a casual and lively tone."

Once you say it like this, what AI gives you changes immediately. It knows what style to use, the length, and who to address.

## Tip #2: Translate "Feelings" into Specific Requirements

"Make it feel right"—this is the most frustrating instruction for AI.

What does "feel right" mean? Everyone feels differently. Instead of letting AI guess, tell it what kind of feeling you want, then translate it into specific expressions.

For example:

❌ Wrong: "Make it more emotionally engaging"

✅ Right: "Start with a question to create resonance, include a specific use case in the middle, and add a data-driven result at the end"

This way, AI's copy is not only emotionally engaging but also clearly structured and easier to use.

## Tip #3: Let AI Generate 5 Versions, Then You Choose

The hardest part of copywriting isn't writing—it's revising.

Instead of struggling to write one version that gets rejected by your boss, let AI generate 5 different style versions first. After you review them, you'll have a better idea.

Then you can tell AI: "I like the opening of version 2 and the ending of version 4. Combine them and adjust the third paragraph to sound more conversational."

This is what AI does best—quickly iterating and revising based on your feedback.

## Practical Example

Here's a real use case:

**Requirement**: Write WeChat Moments (social media) copy for selling oranges

**Basic Input**: "Help me write some WeChat Moments copy for selling oranges"

**Optimized Input**: "You are a lifestyle copywriter. Now I need you to write WeChat Moments copy for a navel orange from Gannan, targeting friends as potential buyers. Requirements: 1) Language should sound like friend chat, not 'wechat merchant' tone 2) Highlight the orange's sweetness and juiciness 3) Include some life-like scene descriptions 4) Keep it under 100 words"

The latter gives much more usable copy.

## Three Principles for Using AI Writing Well

**Principle #1: AI is an Assistant, Not a Ghostwriter**

The best setup is AI writes the first draft, and you do the final review. AI can help open your mind, but you need to add the final human touch.

**Principle #2: Try Multiple Times, Don't Be Afraid of Trouble**

Sometimes AI's first attempt isn't good. Try again with different wording, and you might hit the jackpot. The more you "communicate" with it, the better it understands you.

**Principle #3: Build Your Own Prompt Library**

Save those useful input templates and reuse them for similar needs next time for higher efficiency.

## FAQ

**Q: AI-written copy feels too generic?**

A: Try adding some constraints in your input, like "start with a question," "include a small life story," "use contrast," etc.

**Q: How to make AI understand my product features?**

A: First give AI a clear picture of the product background, target users, and core selling points, then state your specific copy requirements. The more it understands, the more accurate its output.

**Q: Can I use AI-written copy directly?**

A: It's best to review it. AI sometimes uses exaggerated expressions or slightly inaccurate wording. You're the final gatekeeper.
